Erfahren Sie, wie Sie auf einfache Weise einen [Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/developer-faq/#1-what-is-a-subgraph) auf The Graph erstellen, veröffentlichen und abfragen können.

## Voraussetzungen

- Eine Krypto-Wallet
- Eine Smart-Contract-Adresse in einem [unterstützten Netzwerk](/supported-networks/
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installiert
- Ein Paketmanager Ihrer Wahl (`npm`, `yarn` oder `pnpm`)

## Wie man einen Subgraphen erstellt

### 1. Erstellen Sie einen Subgraphen in Subgraph Studio

Gehen Sie zu [Subgraph Studio] (https://thegraph.com/studio/) und verbinden Sie Ihre Wallet.

Mit Subgraph Studio können Sie Subgraphen erstellen, verwalten, bereitstellen und veröffentlichen sowie API-Schlüssel erstellen und verwalten.

Click "Create a Subgraph". It is recommended to name the Subgraph in Title Case: "Subgraph Name Chain Name".

### 2. Installieren der Graph-CLI

Führen Sie einen der folgenden Befehle auf Ihrem lokalen Computer aus:

Verwendung von [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli@latest
```

Verwendung von [yarn] (https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### 3. Initialisieren Sie Ihren Subgraphen

> Sie finden die Befehle für Ihren spezifischen Subgraphen auf der Subgraphen-Seite in [Subgraph Studio] (https://thegraph.com/studio/).

Der Befehl `graph init` erstellt automatisch ein Gerüst eines Subgraphen auf der Grundlage der Ereignisse Ihres Vertrags.

Der folgende Befehl initialisiert Ihren Subgraphen anhand eines bestehenden Vertrags:

```sh
graph init
```

If your contract is verified on the respective blockscanner where it is deployed (such as [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)), then the ABI will automatically be created in the CLI.

When you initialize your Subgraph, the CLI will ask you for the following information:

- **Protocol**: Choose the protocol your Subgraph will be indexing data from.
- **Subgraph slug**: Create a name for your Subgraph. Your Subgraph slug is an identifier for your Subgraph.
- **Directory**: Choose a directory to create your Subgraph in.
- **Ethereum network** (optional): You may need to specify which EVM-compatible network your Subgraph will be indexing data from.
- **Contract address**: Locate the smart contract address you’d like to query data from.
- **ABI**: If the ABI is not auto-populated, you will need to input it manually as a JSON file.
- **Start Block**: You should input the start block to optimize Subgraph indexing of blockchain data. Locate the start block by finding the block where your contract was deployed.
- **Contract Name**: Input the name of your contract.
- **Index contract events as entities**: It is suggested that you set this to true, as it will automatically add mappings to your Subgraph for every emitted event.
- **Add another contract** (optional): You can add another contract.

See the following screenshot for an example for what to expect when initializing your Subgraph:

![Subgraph command](/img/CLI-Example.png)

### 4. Edit your Subgraph

The `init` command in the previous step creates a scaffold Subgraph that you can use as a starting point to build your Subgraph.

When making changes to the Subgraph, you will mainly work with three files:

- Manifest (`subgraph.yaml`) - defines what data sources your Subgraph will index.
- Schema (`schema.graphql`) - defines what data you wish to retrieve from the Subgraph.
- AssemblyScript Mappings (mapping.ts) - Dies ist der Code, der die Daten aus Ihren Datenquellen in die im Schema definierten Entitäten übersetzt.

For a detailed breakdown on how to write your Subgraph, check out [Creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

### 5. Deploy your Subgraph

> Remember, deploying is not the same as publishing.

When you **deploy** a Subgraph, you push it to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/), where you can test, stage and review it. A deployed Subgraph's indexing is performed by the [Upgrade Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/upgrade-indexer/), which is a single Indexer owned and operated by Edge & Node, rather than by the many decentralized Indexers in The Graph Network. A **deployed** Subgraph is free to use, rate-limited, not visible to the public, and meant to be used for development, staging, and testing purposes.

Once your Subgraph is written, run the following commands:

````
```sh
graph codegen && graph build
```
````

Authenticate and deploy your Subgraph. The deploy key can be found on the Subgraph's page in Subgraph Studio.

![Deploy key](/img/subgraph-studio-deploy-key.jpg)

````
```sh

graph auth <DEPLOY_KEY>

graph deploy <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```
````

The CLI will ask for a version label. It's strongly recommended to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), e.g. `0.0.1`.

### 6. Review your Subgraph

If you’d like to test your Subgraph before publishing it, you can use [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to do the following:

- Führen Sie eine Testabfrage durch.
- Analyze your Subgraph in the dashboard to check information.
- Check the logs on the dashboard to see if there are any errors with your Subgraph. The logs of an operational Subgraph will look like this:

  ![Subgraph logs](/img/subgraph-logs-image.png)

### 7. Publish your Subgraph to The Graph Network

When your Subgraph is ready for a production environment, you can publish it to the decentralized network. Publishing is an onchain action that does the following:

- It makes your Subgraph available to be to indexed by the decentralized [Indexers](/indexing/overview/) on The Graph Network.
- It removes rate limits and makes your Subgraph publicly searchable and queryable in [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/).
- It makes your Subgraph available for [Curators](/resources/roles/curating/) to curate it.

> The greater the amount of GRT you and others curate on your Subgraph, the more Indexers will be incentivized to index your Subgraph, improving the quality of service, reducing latency, and enhancing network redundancy for your Subgraph.

#### Veröffentlichung mit Subgraph Studio

To publish your Subgraph, click the Publish button in the dashboard.

![Publish a Subgraph on Subgraph Studio](/img/publish-sub-transfer.png)

Select the network to which you would like to publish your Subgraph.

#### Veröffentlichen über die CLI

As of version 0.73.0, you can also publish your Subgraph with the Graph CLI.

Öffnen Sie den `graph-cli`.

Verwenden Sie die folgenden Befehle:

````
```sh
graph codegen && graph build
```

Then,

```sh
graph publish
```
````

3. A window will open, allowing you to connect your wallet, add metadata, and deploy your finalized Subgraph to a network of your choice.

![cli-ui](/img/cli-ui.png)

To customize your deployment, see [Publishing a Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/).

#### Adding signal to your Subgraph

1. To attract Indexers to query your Subgraph, you should add GRT curation signal to it.

   - This action improves quality of service, reduces latency, and enhances network redundancy and availability for your Subgraph.

2. Indexer erhalten GRT Rewards auf der Grundlage des signalisierten Betrags, wenn sie für Indexing Rewards in Frage kommen.

   - It’s recommended to curate at least 3,000 GRT to attract 3 Indexers. Check reward eligibility based on Subgraph feature usage and supported networks.

To learn more about curation, read [Curating](/resources/roles/curating/).

To save on gas costs, you can curate your Subgraph in the same transaction you publish it by selecting this option:

![Subgraph veröffentlichen](/img/studio-publish-modal.png)

### 8. Query your Subgraph

You now have access to 100,000 free queries per month with your Subgraph on The Graph Network!

You can query your Subgraph by sending GraphQL queries to its Query URL, which you can find by clicking the Query button.

For more information about querying data from your Subgraph, read [Querying The Graph](/subgraphs/querying/introduction/).
