title: Managing API keys
---

## Überblick

API keys are needed to query subgraphs. They ensure that the connections between application services are valid and authorized, including authenticating the end user and the device using the application.

### Create and Manage API Keys

Go to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and click the **API Keys** tab to create and manage your API keys for specific subgraphs.

The "API keys" table lists existing API keys and allows you to manage or delete them. For each key, you can see its status, the cost for the current period, the spending limit for the current period, and the total number of queries.

You can click the "three dots" menu to the right of a given API key to:

- Rename API key
- Regenerate API key
- Delete API key
- Manage spending limit: this is an optional monthly spending limit for a given API key, in USD. This limit is per billing period (calendar month).

### API Key Details

You can click on an individual API key to view the Details page:

1. Under the **Overview** section, you can:
   - Edit your key name
   - Regenerate API keys
   - View the current usage of the API key with stats:
     - Number of queries
     - Amount of GRT spent
2. Under the **Security** section, you can opt into security settings depending on the level of control you’d like to have. Specifically, you can:
   - View and manage the domain names authorized to use your API key
   - Assign subgraphs that can be queried with your API key
