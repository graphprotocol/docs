title: Fair Use Policy
---

> Effective Date: May 15, 2025

## Überblick

This outlines storage limits for Subgraphs that rely solely on [Edge & Node's Upgrade Indexer](/subgraphs/upgrade-indexer/). This policy is designed to ensure fair and optimized use of queries across the community.

To maintain performance and reliability across its infrastructure, Edge & Node is updating its Upgrade Indexer Subgraph storage policy. Free usage tiers remain available, but users who exceed specified limits will need to upgrade to a paid plan. Storage allocations and thresholds vary by feature.

### 1. Scope

This policy applies to all individual users, teams, chains, and dapps using Edge & Node's Upgrade Indexer in Subgraph Studio for storage and queries.

### 2. Fair Use Storage Limits

**Free Storage: Up to 10 GB**

Beyond that, pricing is variable and adjusts based on usage patterns, network conditions, infrastructure requirements, and specific use cases.

Reach out to Edge & Node at [info@edgeandnode.com](mailto:info@edgeandnode.com) to discuss options that meet your technical needs.

You can monitor your usage via [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

### 3. Fair Use Limits

To preserve the stability of Edge & Node's Subgraph Studio and preserve the reliability of The Graph Network, the Edge & Node Support Team will monitor storage usage and take corresponding action with Subgraphs that have:

- Abnormally high or sustained bandwidth or storage usage beyond posted limits
- Circumvention of storage thresholds (e.g., use of multiple free-tier accounts)

The Edge & Node Support Team reserves the right to revise storage limits or impose temporary constraints for operational integrity.

If you exceed your included storage:

- Try [pruning Subgraph data](/subgraphs/best-practices/pruning/) to remove unused entities and help stay within storage limits
- [Add signal to the Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph) to encourage other Indexers on the network to serve it
- You will receive multiple notifications and email alerts
- A grace period of 14 days will be provided to upgrade or reduce storage

Edge & Node's team is committed to helping users avoid unnecessary interruptions and will continue to support all web3 builders.

### 4. Subgraph Data Retention

Subgraphs inactive for over 14 days or Subgraphs that exceed free-tier storage limits will be subject to automatic data archival or deletion. Edge & Node's team will notify you before any such actions are taken.

### 5. Support

If you believe your usage is incorrectly flagged or have unique use cases (e.g. approved special request pending new Subgraph upgrade plan), reach out the Edge & Node team at [info@edgeandnode.com](mailto:info@edgeandnode.com).
