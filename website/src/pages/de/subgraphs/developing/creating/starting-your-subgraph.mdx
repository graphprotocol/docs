title: Starten Ihres Subgraphen
---

## Überblick

The Graph is home to thousands of Subgraphs already available for query, so check [The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and find one that already matches your needs.

When you create a [Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/), you create a custom open API that extracts data from a blockchain, processes it, stores it, and makes it easy to query via GraphQL.

Subgraph development ranges from simple scaffold Subgraphs to advanced, specifically tailored Subgraphs.

### Start des Erstellens

Start the process and build a Subgraph that matches your needs:

1. [Installieren der CLI](/subgraphs/developing/creating/install-the-cli/) - Richten Sie Ihre Infrastruktur ein
2. [Subgraph Manifest](/subgraphs/developing/creating/subgraph-manifest/) - Understand a Subgraph's key component
3. [Das GraphQL-Schema](/subgraphs/developing/creating/ql-schema/) - Schreiben Sie Ihr Schema
4. [Schreiben von AssemblyScript-Mappings](/subgraphs/developing/creating/assemblyscript-mappings/) - Schreiben Sie Ihre Mappings
5. [Advanced Features](/subgraphs/developing/creating/advanced/) - Customize your Subgraph with advanced features

Erkunden Sie zusätzliche [Ressourcen für APIs](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/README/) und führen Sie lokale Tests mit [Matchstick](/subgraphs/developing/creating/unit-testing-framework/) durch.
