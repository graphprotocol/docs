> Hinweis: Die Sunrise der dezentralisierten Daten endete am 12. Juni 2024.

## Was war die Sunrise der dezentralisierten Daten?

The Sunrise of Decentralized Data was an initiative spearheaded by Edge & Node. This initiative enabled Subgraph developers to upgrade to The Graph’s decentralized network seamlessly.

This plan drew on previous developments from The Graph ecosystem, including an upgrade Indexer to serve queries on newly published Subgraphs.

### Was ist mit dem gehosteten Dienst passiert?

The hosted service query endpoints are no longer available, and developers cannot deploy new Subgraphs on the hosted service.

During the upgrade process, owners of hosted service Subgraphs could upgrade their Subgraphs to The Graph Network. Additionally, developers were able to claim auto-upgraded Subgraphs.

### Wurde Subgraph Studio durch dieses Upgrade beeinträchtigt?

Nein, Subgraph Studio wurde durch Sunrise nicht beeinträchtigt. Subgraphen standen sofort für Abfragen zur Verfügung, angetrieben durch den Upgrade Indexer, der die gleiche Infrastruktur wie der gehostete Dienst nutzt.

### Why were Subgraphs published to Arbitrum, did it start indexing a different network?

The Graph Network was initially deployed on Ethereum mainnet but was later moved to Arbitrum One in order to lower gas costs for all users. As a result, all new Subgraphs are published to The Graph Network on Arbitrum so that Indexers can support them. Arbitrum is the network that Subgraphs are published to, but Subgraphs can index any of the [supported networks](/supported-networks/)

## Über den Upgrade Indexer

> Der Upgrade Indexer ist derzeit aktiv.

The upgrade Indexer was implemented to improve the experience of upgrading Subgraphs from the hosted service to The Graph Network and support new versions of existing Subgraphs that had not yet been indexed.

### Was macht der Upgrade Indexer?

- It bootstraps chains that have yet to receive indexing rewards on The Graph Network and ensures that an Indexer is available to serve queries as quickly as possible after a Subgraph is published.
- Er unterstützt Ketten, die bisher nur über den gehosteten Dienst verfügbar waren. Eine umfassende Liste der unterstützten Ketten finden Sie [hier](/supported-networks/).
- Indexers that operate an upgrade Indexer do so as a public service to support new Subgraphs and additional chains that lack indexing rewards before The Graph Council approves them.

### Warum führen Edge & Node den Upgrade Indexer aus?

Edge & Node historically maintained the hosted service and, as a result, already have synced data for hosted service Subgraphs.

### Was bedeutet der Upgrade Indexer für bestehende Indexer?

Ketten, die bisher nur vom gehosteten Dienst unterstützt wurden, wurden den Entwicklern auf The Graph Network zunächst ohne Rewards zur Verfügung gestellt.

However, this action unlocked query fees for any interested Indexer and increased the number of Subgraphs published on The Graph Network. As a result, Indexers have more opportunities to index and serve these Subgraphs in exchange for query fees, even before indexing rewards are enabled for a chain.

The upgrade Indexer also provides the Indexer community with information about the potential demand for Subgraphs and new chains on The Graph Network.

### Was bedeutet das für die Delegatoren?

The upgrade Indexer offers a powerful opportunity for Delegators. As it allowed more Subgraphs to be upgraded from the hosted service to The Graph Network, Delegators benefit from the increased network activity.

### Konkurriert der aktualisierte Indexer mit bestehenden Indexern um Rewards?

No, the upgrade Indexer only allocates the minimum amount per Subgraph and does not collect indexing rewards.

It operates on an “as needed” basis, serving as a fallback until sufficient service quality is achieved by at least three other Indexers in the network for respective chains and Subgraphs.

### How does this affect Subgraph developers?

Subgraph developers can query their Subgraphs on The Graph Network almost immediately after upgrading from the hosted service or [publishing from Subgraph Studio](/subgraphs/developing/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/), as no lead time was required for indexing. Please note that [creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/) was not impacted by this upgrade.

### Welchen Nutzen hat der Upgrade-Indexer für die Datenkonsumenten?

Der Upgrade-Indexer ermöglicht Verkettungen im Netz, die bisher nur vom gehosteten Dienst unterstützt wurden. Daher erweitert er den Umfang und die Verfügbarkeit von Daten, die im Netzwerk abgefragt werden können.

### Wie bewertet der Upgrade-Indexer Abfragen?

Der Upgrade-Indexer berechnet Abfragen zum Marktpreis, um den Markt für Abfragegebühren nicht zu beeinflussen.

### When will the upgrade Indexer stop supporting a Subgraph?

The upgrade Indexer supports a Subgraph until at least 3 other Indexers successfully and consistently serve queries made to it.

Furthermore, the upgrade Indexer stops supporting a Subgraph if it has not been queried in the last 30 days.

Other Indexers are incentivized to support Subgraphs with ongoing query volume. The query volume to the upgrade Indexer should trend towards zero, as it has a small allocation size, and other Indexers should be chosen for queries ahead of it.
