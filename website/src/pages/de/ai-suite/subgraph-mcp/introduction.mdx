Subgraph MCP server is an open-source implementation of [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

It presents The Graph's Subgraph data through a set of MCP tools that any MCP-compatible client can call. With these tools, clients can search for relevant Subgraphs, inspect GraphQL schemas, and run queries against specific deployments on The Graph Network all within a single, standardized interface.

The server itself does not hold a language model. Instead, it translates incoming MCP requests into Subgraph queries and returns the structured results, allowing the client's LLM to transform a natural-language prompt into actionable blockchain data.

Think of it as a USB-C hub: it standardizes the plug-and-play connection between AI agents and The Graph's Subgraph ecosystem.

## What You Can Do

- Access GraphQL schemas for any Subgraph on The Graph Network
- Run GraphQL queries on any Subgraph deployment
- Discover top Subgraph deployments by keyword or contract address
- Retrieve 30-day query volumes for Subgraph deployments
- Ask questions about Subgraph data without writing GraphQL manually

The Subgraph MCP server allows smooth integration with [Claude](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/claude/), [Cline](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/cline/), or [Cursor](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/cursor/), making blockchain data queries with The Graph Network a conversational experience.
