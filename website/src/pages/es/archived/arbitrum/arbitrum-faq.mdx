## Why did The Graph implement an L2 Solution?

By scaling The Graph on L2, network participants can now benefit from:

- Upwards of 26x savings on gas fees

- Mayor velocidad de transacción

- Security inherited from Ethereum

Scaling the protocol smart contracts onto L2 allows network participants to interact more frequently at a reduced cost in gas fees. For example, Indexers can open and close allocations more frequently to index a greater number of Subgraphs. Developers can deploy and update Subgraphs more easily, and Delegators can delegate GRT more frequently. Curators can add or remove signal to a larger number of Subgraphs–actions previously considered too cost-prohibitive to perform frequently due to gas.

The Graph community decided to move forward with Arbitrum last year after the outcome of the [GIP-0031](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0031-arbitrum-grt-bridge/3305) discussion.

## ¿Qué debo hacer para usar The Graph en L2?

The Graph’s billing system accepts GRT on Arbitrum, and users will need ETH on Arbitrum to pay their gas. While The Graph protocol started on Ethereum Mainnet, all activity, including the billing contracts, is now on Arbitrum One.

Consequently, to pay for queries, you need GRT on Arbitrum. Here are a few different ways to achieve this:

- If you already have GRT on Ethereum, you can bridge it to Arbitrum. You can do this via the GRT bridging option provided in Subgraph Studio or by using one of the following bridges:

  - [The Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
  - [TransferTo](https://transferto.xyz/swap)

- If you have other assets on Arbitrum, you can swap them for GRT through a swapping protocol like Uniswap.

- Alternatively, you can acquire GRT directly on Arbitrum through a decentralized exchange.

Once you have GRT on Arbitrum, you can add it to your billing balance.

## As a Subgraph developer, data consumer, Indexer, Curator, or Delegator, what do I need to do now?

Network participants must move to Arbitrum to continue participating in The Graph Network. Please refer to [L2 Transfer Tool Guide](/archived/arbitrum/l2-transfer-tools-guide/) for additional support.

All indexing rewards are now entirely on Arbitrum.

## Were there any risks associated with scaling the network to L2?

All smart contracts have been thoroughly [audited](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/main/packages/contracts/audits/OpenZeppelin/2022-07-graph-arbitrum-bridge-audit.pdf).

Everything has been tested thoroughly, and a contingency plan is in place to ensure a safe and seamless transition. Details can be found [here](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0037-the-graph-arbitrum-deployment-with-linear-rewards-minted-in-l2/3551#risks-and-security-considerations-20).

## Are existing Subgraphs on Ethereum working?

All Subgraphs are now on Arbitrum. Please refer to [L2 Transfer Tool Guide](/archived/arbitrum/l2-transfer-tools-guide/) to ensure your Subgraphs operate seamlessly.

## Does GRT have a new smart contract deployed on Arbitrum?

Yes, GRT has an additional [smart contract on Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9623063377ad1b27544c965ccd7342f7ea7e88c7). However, the Ethereum mainnet [GRT contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7) will remain operational.

## Preguntas frecuentes sobre facturación en Arbitrum

## ¿Qué debo hacer con el GRT en mi saldo de facturación?

¡Nada! Tu GRT se ha migrado de forma segura a Arbitrum y se está utilizando para pagar consultas mientras lees esto.

## ¿Cómo sé que mis fondos han migrado de forma segura a Arbitrum?

All GRT billing balances have already been successfully migrated to Arbitrum. You can view the billing contract on Arbitrum [here](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1B07D3344188908Fb6DEcEac381f3eE63C48477a).

## ¿Cómo sé que el bridge Arbitrum es seguro?

The bridge has been [heavily audited](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-the-graph-l2-bridge-contest) to ensure safety and security for all users.

## ¿Qué debo hacer si agrego GRT fresco de mi billetera mainnet de Ethereum?

Adding GRT to your Arbitrum billing balance can be done with a one-click experience in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/). You'll be able to easily bridge your GRT to Arbitrum and fill your API keys in one transaction.

Visit the [Billing page](/subgraphs/billing/) for more detailed instructions on adding, withdrawing, or acquiring GRT.
