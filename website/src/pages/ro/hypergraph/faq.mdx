## General Questions

### What is Hypergraph?

Hypergraph is a TypeScript-first framework for building local-first apps that syncs encrypted data to a shared knowledge graph.

### Does it replace my backend?

Yes. Hypergraph is your data layer. You still host a thin sync server, but your business logic lives entirely on the client.

### Who is Hypergraph for?

Developers building collaborative, consumer-facing apps that require real-time data sync, end-to-end encryption, and public knowledge graph interoperability. Ideal for those who want to focus on client-side logic without managing backend infrastructure.

### What problems does Hypergraph solve?

* Real-time sync of private data across users and devices with E2EE
* No traditional backend or database required (framework handles storage and sync)
* Publishing and consuming public data in an interoperable knowledge graph
* Built-in user authentication and access control
* Enables network effects by reusing existing data across apps

### What should developers know?

You should be comfortable writing React applications in TypeScript and familiar with common UI patterns (e.g., inboxes).

## Implementation Questions

### How can I integrate Hypergraph into an existing application?

You can add Hypergraph as a collaboration and privacy layer to an existing app, enabling real-time sync and end-to-end encryption while keeping your current stack for other functionality.

### What are Spaces?

Spaces are the primary grouping for users and content in Hypergraph: they represent collaboration contexts and topics. Only members of a space can access its private data.

### How do I get started?

Check out the [Quickstart](https://docs.hypergraph.thegraph.com/docs/quickstart).

### Where can I find the API reference?

Refer to the [API Reference](https://docs.hypergraph.thegraph.com/docs/api-reference/hypergraph/).

### How do I troubleshoot common errors?

Find solutions in the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.hypergraph.thegraph.com/docs/troubleshooting).

## Support and Community

### Where can I find more examples or support?

Browse our GitHub repository for sample apps and open issues. Join the community through our issue tracker and discussion forums.

### How can I share feedback?

Provide feedback via GitHub issues or our upcoming feedback form linked in the docs.

### Is Hypergraph open-source?

100%. Apache-2.0 license. Contributions are welcomed.

## Security and Privacy

### Can the server read my private data?

No. All private content is encrypted client-side with a per-Space symmetric key.

### What happens if I lose my keys?

Today you're out of luck (similar to Signal). A social recovery scheme is on the roadmap. Follow [#51](https://github.com/graphprotocol/hypergraph/issues/51).
