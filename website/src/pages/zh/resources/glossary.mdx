- **The Graph**: 用于索引和查询数据的去中心化协议。

- **Query**: 对数据的请求。对于The Graph，查询是从子图中请求数据，并由索引人回答。

- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. The Graph uses GraphQL to query subgraphs.

- **Endpoint**：可用于查询子图的URL。Subgraph Studio的测试端点为`https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<ID>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/<VERSION>`，Graph资源管理器端点为`https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<API_KEY>/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_id>`。Graph Explorer端点用于查询The Graph去中心化网络上的子图。

- **Subgraph**：一个开放的API，它从区块链中提取数据，对其进行处理并存储，以便通过GraphQL轻松查询。开发人员可以构建、部署和发布子图到The Graph网络。一旦它被索引，任何人都可以查询子图。

- **Indexers**：网络参与者运行索引节点，从区块链索引数据并提供 GraphQL 查询。

- **Indexer Revenue Streams**：索引人在 GRT 中的获得包括两个组成部分: 查询费用回扣和索引奖励。

  1. **Query Fee Rebates**: 子图消费者为网络上的查询提供服务支付的费用。

  2. **Indexing Rewards**: 索引人因为索引子图而获得的奖励。索引奖励是通过每年发行3% 的 GRT 来产生的。

- **Indexer's Self-Stake**: The amount of GRT that Indexers stake to participate in the decentralized network. The minimum is 100,000 GRT, and there is no upper limit.

- **Delegation Capacity**: The maximum amount of GRT an Indexer can accept from Delegators. Indexers can only accept up to 16x their Indexer Self-Stake, and additional delegation results in diluted rewards. For example, if an Indexer has a Self-Stake of 1M GRT, their delegation capacity is 16M. However, Indexers can increase their Delegation Capacity by increasing their Self-Stake.

- **Upgrade Indexer**: An Indexer designed to act as a fallback for subgraph queries not serviced by other Indexers on the network. The upgrade Indexer is not competitive with other Indexers.

- **Delegators**: 拥有 GRT 并将其 GRT 委托给索引人的网络参与者。这使得索引人可以增加它们在网络子图中的份额。作为回报，委托方将获得索引人为处理子图而获得的索引奖励的一部分。

- **Delegation Tax**: A 0.5% fee paid by Delegators when they delegate GRT to Indexers. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Curator**: Network participants that identify high-quality subgraphs, and signal GRT on them in exchange for curation shares. When Indexers claim query fees on a subgraph, 10% is distributed to the Curators of that subgraph. There is a positive correlation between the amount of GRT signaled and the number of Indexers indexing a subgraph.

- **Curation Tax**: A 1% fee paid by Curators when they signal GRT on subgraphs. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Data Consumer**: 查询子图的任何应用程序或用户。

- **Subgraph Developer**: 构建并部署子图到The Graph 去中心化网络的开发人员。

- **Subgraph Manifest**: A YAML file that describes the subgraph's GraphQL schema, data sources, and other metadata. [Here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph/blob/master/subgraph.yaml) is an example.

- **Epoch**: 网络中的时间单位。一个时期目前为6,646个区块或大约1天。

- **Allocation**: An Indexer can allocate their total GRT stake (including Delegators' stake) towards subgraphs that have been published on The Graph's decentralized network. Allocations can have different statuses:

  1. **Active**: An allocation is considered active when it is created onchain. This is called opening an allocation, and indicates to the network that the Indexer is actively indexing and serving queries for a particular subgraph. Active allocations accrue indexing rewards proportional to the signal on the subgraph, and the amount of GRT allocated.

  2. **Closed**: An Indexer may claim the accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph by submitting a recent, and valid, Proof of Indexing (POI). This is known as closing an allocation. An allocation must have been open for a minimum of one epoch before it can be closed. The maximum allocation period is 28 epochs. If an Indexer leaves an allocation open beyond 28 epochs, it is known as a stale allocation. When an allocation is in the **Closed** state, a Fisherman can still open a dispute to challenge an Indexer for serving false data.

- **Subgraph Studio**: A powerful dapp for building, deploying, and publishing subgraphs.

- **Fishermen**: A role within The Graph Network held by participants who monitor the accuracy and integrity of data served by Indexers. When a Fisherman identifies a query response or a POI they believe to be incorrect, they can initiate a dispute against the Indexer. If the dispute rules in favor of the Fisherman, the Indexer is slashed by losing 2.5% of their self-stake. Of this amount, 50% is awarded to the Fisherman as a bounty for their vigilance, and the remaining 50% is removed from circulation (burned). This mechanism is designed to encourage Fishermen to help maintain the reliability of the network by ensuring that Indexers are held accountable for the data they provide.

- **Arbitrators**: Arbitrators are network participants appointed through a governance process. The role of the Arbitrator is to decide the outcome of indexing and query disputes. Their goal is to maximize the utility and reliability of The Graph Network.

- **Slashing**: Indexers can have their self-staked GRT slashed for providing an incorrect POI or for serving inaccurate data. The slashing percentage is a protocol parameter currently set to 2.5% of an Indexer's self-stake. 50% of the slashed GRT goes to the Fisherman that disputed the inaccurate data or incorrect POI. The other 50% is burned.

- **Indexing Rewards**: The rewards that Indexers receive for indexing subgraphs. Indexing rewards are distributed in GRT.

- **Delegation Rewards**: The rewards that Delegators receive for delegating GRT to Indexers. Delegation rewards are distributed in GRT.

- **GRT**: The Graph's work utility token. GRT provides economic incentives to network participants for contributing to the network.

- **Proof of Indexing (POI)**: When an Indexer closes their allocation and wants to claim their accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph, they must provide a valid and recent POI. Fishermen may dispute the POI provided by an Indexer. A dispute resolved in the Fisherman's favor will result in slashing of the Indexer.

- **Graph Node**: Graph Node is the component that indexes subgraphs and makes the resulting data available to query via a GraphQL API. As such it is central to the Indexer stack, and correct operation of Graph Node is crucial to running a successful Indexer.

- **Indexer agent**: The Indexer agent is part of the Indexer stack. It facilitates the Indexer's interactions onchain, including registering on the network, managing subgraph deployments to its Graph Node(s), and managing allocations.

- **The Graph Client**: A library for building GraphQL-based dapps in a decentralized way.

- **Graph Explorer**: A dapp designed for network participants to explore subgraphs and interact with the protocol.

- **Graph CLI**: A command line interface tool for building and deploying to The Graph.

- **Cooldown Period**: The time remaining until an Indexer who changed their delegation parameters can do so again.

- **L2 Transfer Tools**: Smart contracts and UI that enable network participants to transfer network related assets from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum One. Network participants can transfer delegated GRT, subgraphs, curation shares, and Indexer's self-stake.

- **Updating a subgraph**: The process of releasing a new subgraph version with updates to the subgraph's manifest, schema, or mappings.

- **Migrating**: 策展份额从子图的旧版本移动到子图的新版本的过程（例如，从 v0.0.1 更新到 v0.0.2）。
