- **Graph**: 用于索引和查询数据的去中心化协议。

- **Query**: 对数据的请求。对于Graph，查询是从子图中请求数据，并由索引人回答。

- **GraphQL**: 用于 API 的查询语言，以及用现有数据实现这些查询的运行。Graph 使用 GraphQL 查询子图。

- **Endpoint**: 可以用来查询子图的URL。Subgraph Studio的测试端点是`https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<ID>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/<VERSION>`，Graph浏览器端点`为https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<API_KEY>/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_ID>`。Graph浏览器端点用于查询Graph的去中心化网络上的子图。

- **Subgraph**: An open API that extracts data from a blockchain, processes it, and stores it so that it can be easily queried via GraphQL. Developers can build, deploy, and publish subgraphs to The Graph Network. Once it is indexed, the subgraph can be queried by anyone.

- **Indexer**: Network participants that run indexing nodes to index data from blockchains and serve GraphQL queries.

- **Indexer Revenue Streams**：索引人在 GRT 中获得两个组成部分: 查询费用回扣和索引奖励。

  1. **Query Fee Rebates**: 子图消费者为网络上的查询提供服务支付的费用。

  2. **Indexing Rewards**: 索引人因为索引子图而获得的奖励。索引奖励是通过每年发行3% 的 GRT 来产生的。

- **Indexer's Self-Stake**: The amount of GRT that Indexers stake to participate in the decentralized network. The minimum is 100,000 GRT, and there is no upper limit.

- **Upgrade Indexer**: An Indexer designed to act as a fallback for subgraph queries not serviced by other Indexers on the network. The upgrade Indexer is not competitive with other Indexers.

- **Delegator**: Network participants who own GRT and delegate their GRT to Indexers. This allows Indexers to increase their stake in subgraphs on the network. In return, Delegators receive a portion of the Indexing Rewards that Indexers receive for processing subgraphs.

- **Delegation Tax**: 委托人将 GRT 委托给索引人时支付的0.5% 的费用。用于支付费用的 GRT 将被消耗。

- **Curator**: Network participants that identify high-quality subgraphs, and signal GRT on them in exchange for curation shares. When Indexers claim query fees on a subgraph, 10% is distributed to the Curators of that subgraph. There is a positive correlation between the amount of GRT signaled and the number of Indexers indexing a subgraph.

- **Curation Tax**: 当策展人在子图上显示 GRT 时，他们要支付1% 的费用。用于支付费用的 GRT 将被消耗。

- **Data Consumer**: Any application or user that queries a subgraph.

- **Subgraph Developer**: 构建并部署子图到 Graph 去中心化网络的开发人员。

- **Subgraph Manifest**: A YAML file that describes the subgraph's GraphQL schema, data sources, and other metadata. [Here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph/blob/master/subgraph.yaml) is an example.

- **Epoch**: 网络中的时间单位。一个时期目前为6,646个区块或大约1天。

- **Allocation**: An Indexer can allocate their total GRT stake (including Delegators' stake) towards subgraphs that have been published on The Graph's decentralized network. Allocations can have different statuses:

  1. **Active**: 分配在链上创建时被认为是活动的。这称为打开一个分配，并向网络表明索引人正在为特定子图建立索引并提供查询服务。主动分配的增值索引奖励与子图上的信号以及分配的 GRT 的数量成比例。

  2. **Closed**: An Indexer may claim the accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph by submitting a recent, and valid, Proof of Indexing (POI). This is known as closing an allocation. An allocation must have been open for a minimum of one epoch before it can be closed. The maximum allocation period is 28 epochs. If an Indexer leaves an allocation open beyond 28 epochs, it is known as a stale allocation. When an allocation is in the **Closed** state, a Fisherman can still open a dispute to challenge an Indexer for serving false data.

- **Subgraph Studio**: 用于构建、部署和发布子图的强大 dapp。

- **Fishermen**: A role within The Graph Network held by participants who monitor the accuracy and integrity of data served by Indexers. When a Fisherman identifies a query response or a POI they believe to be incorrect, they can initiate a dispute against the Indexer. If the dispute rules in favor of the Fisherman, the Indexer is slashed by losing 2.5% of their self-stake. Of this amount, 50% is awarded to the Fisherman as a bounty for their vigilance, and the remaining 50% is removed from circulation (burned). This mechanism is designed to encourage Fishermen to help maintain the reliability of the network by ensuring that Indexers are held accountable for the data they provide.

- **Arbitrators**: 仲裁员是通过治理设置的网络参与者。仲裁员的作用是决定索引和查询争议的结果。他们的目标是最大限度地提高Graph网络的效用和可靠性。

- **Slashing**: Indexers can have their self-staked GRT slashed for providing an incorrect POI or for serving inaccurate data. The slashing percentage is a protocol parameter currently set to 2.5% of an Indexer's self-stake. 50% of the slashed GRT goes to the Fisherman that disputed the inaccurate data or incorrect POI. The other 50% is burned.

- **Indexing Rewards**: 索引人因为索引子图而获得的奖励。索引奖励是通过GRT 来分配的。

- **Delegation Rewards**: 委托人将 GRT 委托给索引人所获得的奖励。委托奖励以 GRT 的形式分配。

- **GRT**: Graph的工作效用代币。 GRT 为网络参与者提供经济激励，鼓励他们为网络做出贡献。

- **Proof of Indexing (POI)**: When an Indexer closes their allocation and wants to claim their accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph, they must provide a valid and recent POI. Fishermen may dispute the POI provided by an Indexer. A dispute resolved in the Fisherman's favor will result in slashing of the Indexer.

- **Graph Node**: Graph Node is the component that indexes subgraphs and makes the resulting data available to query via a GraphQL API. As such it is central to the Indexer stack, and correct operation of Graph Node is crucial to running a successful Indexer.

- **Indexer agent**: The Indexer agent is part of the Indexer stack. It facilitates the Indexer's interactions on-chain, including registering on the network, managing subgraph deployments to its Graph Node(s), and managing allocations.

- **The Graph Client**: 用于以去中心化方式构建基于 GraphQL 的 dapps 的库。

- **Graph Explorer**: 为网络参与者探索子图并与协议交互而设计的 dapp。

- **Graph CLI**: 用于构建和部署到 Graph 的命令行界面工具。

- **Cooldown Period**: 直到更改其委托参数的索引人可以再次进行此操作之前的剩余时间。

- **L2 Transfer Tools**: Smart contracts and UI that enable network participants to transfer network related assets from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum One. Network participants can transfer delegated GRT, subgraphs, curation shares, and Indexer's self-stake.

- **Updating a subgraph**: The process of releasing a new subgraph version with updates to the subgraph's manifest, schema, or mappings.

- **Migrating**: 策展份额从子图的旧版本移动到子图的新版本的过程（例如，从 v0.0.1 更新到 v0.0.2）。
