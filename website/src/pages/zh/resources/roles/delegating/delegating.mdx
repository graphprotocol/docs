To start delegating right away, check out [delegate on the graph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/delegate?chain=arbitrum-one).

## Overview

委托人通过将GRT委托给索引人来获得GRT，这有助于网络安全和功能。

## 委托的好处

- 通过支持索引人来增强网络的安全性和可扩展性。
- 赚取索引人生成的奖励的一部分。

## 委托是如何运作的？

委托人从他们选择委托GRT的索引人那里获得GRT奖励。

索引人处理查询和获得奖励的能力取决于三个关键因素：

1. 索引人的自我质押（由索引人质押的GRT）。
2. 委托人委托给他们的总GRT。
3. 索引人为查询设置的价格。

GRT质押和委托给索引人的越多，它们可以服务的查询就越多，从而为委托人和索引人带来更高的潜在回报。

### 什么是委托能力？

Delegation Capacity refers to the maximum amount of GRT an Indexer can accept from Delegators, based on the Indexer's Self-Stake.

The Graph Network includes a delegation ratio of 16, meaning an Indexer can accept up to 16 times their Self-Stake in delegated GRT.

For example, if an Indexer has a Self-Stake of 1M GRT, their Delegation Capacity is 16M.

### Why Does Delegation Capacity Matter?

If an Indexer exceeds their Delegation Capacity, rewards for all Delegators become diluted because the excess delegated GRT cannot be used effectively within the protocol.

This makes it crucial for Delegators to evaluate an Indexer's current Delegation Capacity before selecting an Indexer.

Indexers can increase their Delegation Capacity by increasing their Self-Stake, thereby raising the limit for delegated tokens.

- 如何计算作为委托人的预期回报

## 委托风险

下面列出了作为协议中的委托人的主要风险。

### 委托税

委托人不能因为不良行为而被取消，但对委托有税，以抑制可能损害网络完整性的不良决策。

As a Delegator, it's important to understand the following:

- You will be charged 0.5% every time you delegate. This means that if you delegate 1,000 GRT, you will automatically burn 5 GRT.

- In order to be safe, you should calculate your potential return when delegating to an Indexer. For example, you might calculate how many days it will take before you have earned back the 0.5% tax on your delegation.

### The Undelegation Period

When a Delegator chooses to undelegate, their tokens are subject to a 28-day undelegation period.

这意味着他们在 28 天内不能转移他们的代币，也不能获得任何奖励。

After the undelegation period, GRT will return to your crypto wallet.

### Why is this important?

If you choose an Indexer that is not trustworthy or not doing a good job, you will want to undelegate. This means you will be losing opportunities to earn rewards.

因此，建议您明智地选择索引人。

#### Delegation Parameters

In order to understand how to choose a trustworthy Indexer, you need to understand the Delegation Parameters.

- **Indexing Reward Cut** - The portion of the rewards the Indexer will keep for themselves.
  - If an Indexer's reward cut is set to 100%, as a Delegator, you will get 0 indexing rewards.
  - If it is set to 80%, as a Delegator, you will receive 20%.

![Indexing Reward Cut. The top Indexer is giving Delegators 90% of the rewards. The middle one is giving Delegators 20%. The bottom one is giving Delegators ~83%.](/img/Indexing-Reward-Cut.png)

- **Query Fee Cut** - This is just like the Indexing Reward Cut, but it applies to returns on the query fees that the Indexer collects.

- 强烈建议您探索[The Graph Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol) ，以确定哪些索引人具有最佳的社会和技术声誉。

- 许多索引人在 Discord 中非常活跃，他们将很乐意回答您的问题。

## Calculating Delegators Expected Return

> 在[此处](https://thegraph.com/explorer/delegate?chain=arbitrum-one)，计算您的委托的投资回报率。

委托人在确定收益时必须考虑很多因素：

索引人使用委托的GRT的能力会影响他们的奖励。

如果索引人没有分配所有可支配的GRT，他们可能会错过为自己和委托人实现潜在收益最大化的机会。

索引人可以在1到28天的窗口内随时关闭分配并收集奖励。然而，如果没有及时领取奖励，即使有一部分奖励无人领取，总奖励也可能会显得较低。

### 考虑到查询费用的分成和索引费用的分成

您应该选择一个在设置查询费和索引费减免方面透明的索引人。

The formula is:

### 考虑索引人委托池

<VideoEmbed title="How to Choose the Right Indexer for Your Delegation" youtube="G0HyUZ0m_Q8" />

Delegators should consider the proportion of the Delegation Pool they own.

All delegation rewards are shared evenly, with a pool rebalancing based on the amount the Delegator deposited into the pool.

This gives the Delegator a share of the pool:

> The formula above shows that it is possible for an Indexer offering only 20% to Delegators to provide a better reward than an Indexer giving 90%. Simply do the math to determine the best reward.

## 委托人常见问题和错误

### MetaMask“待定交易”错误

At times, attempts to delegate to Indexers via MetaMask can fail and result in prolonged periods of "Pending" or "Queued" transaction attempts.

A simple resolution to this bug is to restart the browser (e.g., using "abort:restart" in the address bar), which will cancel all previous attempts without gas being subtracted from the wallet. Several users who have encountered this issue have reported successful transactions after restarting their browser and attempting to delegate.
