## 什么是Substreams?

Substreams is an exceptionally powerful processing engine capable of consuming rich streams of blockchain data. It allows you to refine and shape blockchain data for fast and seamless digestion by end-user applications.

Specifically, it's a blockchain-agnostic, parallelized, and streaming-first engine that serves as a blockchain data transformation layer. It's powered by [Firehose](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/), and enables developers to write Rust modules, build upon community modules, provide extremely high-performance indexing, and [sink](/substreams/developing/sinks/) their data anywhere.

Substreams is developed by [StreamingFast](https://www.streamingfast.io/). Visit the [Substreams Documentation](/substreams/introduction/) to learn more about Substreams.

## What are Substreams-powered Subgraphs?

[Substreams-powered Subgraphs](/sps/introduction/) combine the power of Substreams with the queryability of Subgraphs. When publishing a Substreams-powered Subgraph, the data produced by the Substreams transformations, can [output entity changes](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-sink-entity-changes/blob/develop/substreams-entity-change/src/tables.rs) that are compatible with Subgraph entities.

If you are already familiar with Subgraph development, note that Substreams-powered Subgraphs can then be queried just as if it had been produced by the AssemblyScript transformation layer. This provides all the benefits of Subgraphs, including a dynamic and flexible GraphQL API.

## How are Substreams-powered Subgraphs different from Subgraphs?

子图由数据源组成，这些数据源指定了在链上发生的事件以及通过用Assemblyscript编写的处理程序应如何转换这些事件。这些事件按照链上发生事件的顺序依次进行处理。

By contrast, substreams-powered Subgraphs have a single datasource which references a substreams package, which is processed by the Graph Node. Substreams have access to additional granular onchain data compared to conventional Subgraphs, and can also benefit from massively parallelised processing, which can mean much faster processing times.

## What are the benefits of using Substreams-powered Subgraphs?

Substreams-powered Subgraphs combine all the benefits of Substreams with the queryability of Subgraphs. They bring greater composability and high-performance indexing to The Graph. They also enable new data use cases; for example, once you've built your Substreams-powered Subgraph, you can reuse your [Substreams modules](https://docs.substreams.dev/reference-material/substreams-components/modules#modules) to output to different [sinks](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/reference-and-specs/manifests#sink) such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Kafka.

## Substreams的优势是什么？

使用Substreams有许多好处，包括：

- 可组合的: Substreams模块具有可组合性，就像乐高积木一样，您可以将它们堆叠起来，并在社区模块的基础上构建，进一步细化公共数据。

- 高性能索引：大规模并行操作（类似于BigQuery）能够使索引速度提升数个数量级。

- Sink anywhere: Sink your data to anywhere you want: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka, Subgraphs, flat files, Google Sheets.

- 可编程：使用代码自定义提取、进行转换时聚合，并为多个传输目标建模输出。

- 访问不作为JSON RPC的一部分的附加数据。

- Firehose的全部好处。

## 什么是Firehose?

Firehose是由[StreamingFast](https://www.streamingfast.io/)开发的区块链数据提取层，从零开始设计，以前所未有的速度处理区块链的完整历史。它提供基于文件和流式优先的方法，是StreamingFast开源技术套件的核心组件，也是Substreams的基础。

请访问[documentation](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/)，了解更多关于Firehose的信息。

## Firehose的优势是什么？

使用Firehose有许多好处，包括：

- 最低延迟和无需轮询：Firehose节点以流优先的方式设计，竞相将块数据推送出去。

- 防止宕机：从头开始为高可用性而设计。

- 不会错过任何数据：Firehose流游标设计用于处理分叉，并在任何情况下都可以继续从上次离开的地方开始。

- 最丰富的数据模型：包含余额变化、完整的调用树、内部交易、日志、存储变更、燃气费用等最佳数据模型。

- 利用平面文件：将区块链数据提取到平面文件中，这是目前最便宜、最优化的计算资源。

## Where can developers access more information about Substreams-powered Subgraphs and Substreams?

[Substreams文档](/substreams/introduction/)将教您如何构建Substreams模块。

The [Substreams-powered Subgraphs documentation](/sps/introduction/) will show you how to package them for deployment on The Graph.

The [latest Substreams Codegen tool](https://streamingfastio.medium.com/substreams-codegen-no-code-tool-to-bootstrap-your-project-a11efe0378c6) will allow you to bootstrap a Substreams project without any code.

## Rust模块在Substreams中扮演什么角色？

Rust modules are the equivalent of the AssemblyScript mappers in Subgraphs. They are compiled to WASM in a similar way, but the programming model allows for parallel execution. They define the sort of transformations and aggregations you want to apply to the raw blockchain data.

See [modules documentation](https://docs.substreams.dev/reference-material/substreams-components/modules#modules) for details.

## 什么使Substreams具有组合性？

在使用Substreams时，组合发生在转换层，从而使得缓存模块可以被重复使用。

As an example, Alice can build a DEX price module, Bob can use it to build a volume aggregator for some tokens of his interest, and Lisa can combine four individual DEX price modules to create a price oracle. A single Substreams request will package all of these individual's modules, link them together, to offer a much more refined stream of data. That stream can then be used to populate a Subgraph, and be queried by consumers.

## How can you build and deploy a Substreams-powered Subgraph?

After [defining](/sps/introduction/) a Substreams-powered Subgraph, you can use the Graph CLI to deploy it in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

## Where can I find examples of Substreams and Substreams-powered Subgraphs?

You can visit [this Github repo](https://github.com/pinax-network/awesome-substreams) to find examples of Substreams and Substreams-powered Subgraphs.

## What do Substreams and Substreams-powered Subgraphs mean for The Graph Network?

The integration promises many benefits, including extremely high-performance indexing and greater composability by leveraging community modules and building on them.
