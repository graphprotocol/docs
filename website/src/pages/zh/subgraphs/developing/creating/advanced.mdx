title: Advanced Subgraph Features
---

## 概述

Add and implement advanced subgraph features to enhanced your subgraph's built.

Starting from `specVersion` `0.0.4`, subgraph features must be explicitly declared in the `features` section at the top level of the manifest file, using their `camelCase` name, as listed in the table below:

| Feature                                              | Name             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| [Non-fatal errors](#non-fatal-errors)                | `nonFatalErrors` |
| [Full-text Search](#defining-fulltext-search-fields) | `fullTextSearch` |
| [Grafting](#grafting-onto-existing-subgraphs)        | `grafting`       |

For instance, if a subgraph uses the **Full-Text Search** and the **Non-fatal Errors** features, the `features` field in the manifest should be:

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.4
description: Gravatar for Ethereum
features:
  - fullTextSearch
  - nonFatalErrors
dataSources: ...
```

> Note that using a feature without declaring it will incur a **validation error** during subgraph deployment, but no errors will occur if a feature is declared but not used.

## Timeseries and Aggregations

Prerequisites:

- Subgraph specVersion must be ≥1.1.0.

Timeseries and aggregations enable your subgraph to track statistics like daily average price, hourly total transfers, and more.

This feature introduces two new types of subgraph entity. Timeseries entities record data points with timestamps. Aggregation entities perform pre-declared calculations on the timeseries data points on an hourly or daily basis, then store the results for easy access via GraphQL.

### Example Schema

```graphql
type Data @entity(timeseries: true) {
  id: Int8!
  timestamp: Timestamp!
  price: BigDecimal!
}

type Stats @aggregation(intervals: ["hour", "day"], source: "Data") {
  id: Int8!
  timestamp: Timestamp!
  sum: BigDecimal! @aggregate(fn: "sum", arg: "price")
}
```

### How to Define Timeseries and Aggregations

Timeseries entities are defined with `@entity(timeseries: true)` in the GraphQL schema. Every timeseries entity must:

- have a unique ID of the int8 type
- have a timestamp of the Timestamp type
- include data that will be used for calculation by aggregation entities.

These Timeseries entities can be saved in regular trigger handlers, and act as the “raw data” for the aggregation entities.

Aggregation entities are defined with `@aggregation` in the GraphQL schema. Every aggregation entity defines the source from which it will gather data (which must be a timeseries entity), sets the intervals (e.g., hour, day), and specifies the aggregation function it will use (e.g., sum, count, min, max, first, last).

Aggregation entities are automatically calculated on the basis of the specified source at the end of the required interval.

#### Available Aggregation Intervals

- `hour`: sets the timeseries period every hour, on the hour.
- `day`: sets the timeseries period every day, starting and ending at 00:00.

#### Available Aggregation Functions

- `sum`: Total of all values.
- `count`: Number of values.
- `min`: Minimum value.
- `max`: Maximum value.
- `first`: First value in the period.
- `last`: Last value in the period.

#### Example Aggregations Query

```graphql
{
  stats(interval: "hour", where: { timestamp_gt: 1704085200 }) {
    id
    timestamp
    sum
  }
}
```

## 非致命错误

在默认情况下，已同步子图上的索引错误会导致子图失败并停止同步。 子图也可以配置为忽略引发错误的处理程序所做的更改, 在出现错误时继续同步。 这使子图作者有时间更正他们的子图，同时继续针对最新区块提供查询，尽管由于导致错误的代码问题，结果可能会不一致。 请注意，某些错误仍然总是致命的，要成为非致命错误，首先需要确定相应的错误是确定性的错误。

> **Note:** The Graph Network does not yet support non-fatal errors, and developers should not deploy subgraphs using that functionality to the network via the Studio.

启用非致命错误需要在子图清单上设置以下功能标志：

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.4
description: Gravatar for Ethereum
features:
    - nonFatalErrors
    ...
```

The query must also opt-in to querying data with potential inconsistencies through the `subgraphError` argument. It is also recommended to query `_meta` to check if the subgraph has skipped over errors, as in the example:

```graphql
foos(first: 100, subgraphError: allow) {
  id
}

_meta {
  hasIndexingErrors
}
```

If the subgraph encounters an error, that query will return both the data and a graphql error with the message `"indexing_error"`, as in this example response:

```graphql
"data": {
    "foos": [
        {
          "id": "0xdead"
        }
    ],
    "_meta": {
        "hasIndexingErrors": true
    }
},
"errors": [
    {
        "message": "indexing_error"
    }
]
```

## IPFS/Arweave File Data Sources

文件数据源是一种新的子图功能，用于以稳健、可扩展的方式在索引期间访问链下数据。文件数据源支持从IPFS和Arweave获取文件。

> 这也为链外数据的确定性索引以及引入任意HTTP源数据奠定了基础。

### 概述

Rather than fetching files "in line" during handler execution, this introduces templates which can be spawned as new data sources for a given file identifier. These new data sources fetch the files, retrying if they are unsuccessful, running a dedicated handler when the file is found.

This is similar to the [existing data source templates](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#data-source-templates), which are used to dynamically create new chain-based data sources.

> This replaces the existing `ipfs.cat` API

### 升级指南

#### Update `graph-ts` and `graph-cli`

File data sources requires graph-ts >=0.29.0 and graph-cli >=0.33.1

#### 添加新的实体类型，当找到文件时将更新该类型

文件数据源不能访问或更新基于链的实体，但必须更新特定于文件的实体。

这可能意味着将现有实体中的字段拆分为单独的实体，并链接在一起。

原始合并实体：

```graphql
type Token @entity {
  id: ID!
  tokenID: BigInt!
  tokenURI: String!
  externalURL: String!
  ipfsURI: String!
  image: String!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  type: String!
  updatedAtTimestamp: BigInt
  owner: User!
}
```

新拆分实体：

```graphql
type Token @entity {
  id: ID!
  tokenID: BigInt!
  tokenURI: String!
  ipfsURI: TokenMetadata
  updatedAtTimestamp: BigInt
  owner: String!
}

type TokenMetadata @entity {
  id: ID!
  image: String!
  externalURL: String!
  name: String!
  description: String!
}
```

如果母实体与生成的文件数据源实体之间的关系为1:1，则最简单的模式是通过使用IPFS CID作为查找将母实体链接到生成的文件实体。如果您在建模新的基于文件的实体时遇到困难，请联系Discord！

> You can use [nested filters](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#example-for-nested-entity-filtering) to filter parent entities on the basis of these nested entities.

#### Add a new templated data source with `kind: file/ipfs` or `kind: file/arweave`

这是在识别出感兴趣的文件时生成的数据源。

```yaml
templates:
  - name: TokenMetadata
    kind: file/ipfs
    mapping:
      apiVersion: 0.0.7
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      file: ./src/mapping.ts
      handler: handleMetadata
      entities:
        - TokenMetadata
      abis:
        - name: Token
          file: ./abis/Token.json
```

> Currently `abis` are required, though it is not possible to call contracts from within file data sources

The file data source must specifically mention all the entity types which it will interact with under `entities`. See [limitations](#limitations) for more details.

#### 创建新处理程序以处理文件

This handler should accept one `Bytes` parameter, which will be the contents of the file, when it is found, which can then be processed. This will often be a JSON file, which can be processed with `graph-ts` helpers ([documentation](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/api/#json-api)).

The CID of the file as a readable string can be accessed via the `dataSource` as follows:

```typescript
const cid = dataSource.stringParam()
```

示例处理程序：

```typescript
import { json, Bytes, dataSource } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'
import { TokenMetadata } from '../generated/schema'

export function handleMetadata(content: Bytes): void {
  let tokenMetadata = new TokenMetadata(dataSource.stringParam())
  const value = json.fromBytes(content).toObject()
  if (value) {
    const image = value.get('image')
    const name = value.get('name')
    const description = value.get('description')
    const externalURL = value.get('external_url')

    if (name && image && description && externalURL) {
      tokenMetadata.name = name.toString()
      tokenMetadata.image = image.toString()
      tokenMetadata.externalURL = externalURL.toString()
      tokenMetadata.description = description.toString()
    }

    tokenMetadata.save()
  }
}
```

#### 需要时生成文件数据源

现在，您可以在执行基于链的处理程序期间创建文件数据源：

- Import the template from the auto-generated `templates`
- call `TemplateName.create(cid: string)` from within a mapping, where the cid is a valid content identifier for IPFS or Arweave

For IPFS, Graph Node supports [v0 and v1 content identifiers](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/), and content identifiers with directories (e.g. `bafyreighykzv2we26wfrbzkcdw37sbrby4upq7ae3aqobbq7i4er3tnxci/metadata.json`).

For Arweave, as of version 0.33.0 Graph Node can fetch files stored on Arweave based on their [transaction ID](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/arweave-node-server/http-api#transactions) from an Arweave gateway ([example file](https://bdxujjl5ev5eerd5ouhhs6o4kjrs4g6hqstzlci5pf6vhxezkgaa.arweave.net/CO9EpX0lekJEfXUOeXncUmMuG8eEp5WJHXl9U9yZUYA)). Arweave supports transactions uploaded via Irys (previously Bundlr), and Graph Node can also fetch files based on [Irys manifests](https://docs.irys.xyz/overview/gateways#indexing).

例子:

```typescript
import { TokenMetadata as TokenMetadataTemplate } from '../generated/templates'

const ipfshash = 'QmaXzZhcYnsisuue5WRdQDH6FDvqkLQX1NckLqBYeYYEfm'
//This example code is for a Crypto coven subgraph. The above ipfs hash is a directory with token metadata for all crypto coven NFTs.

export function handleTransfer(event: TransferEvent): void {
  let token = Token.load(event.params.tokenId.toString())
  if (!token) {
    token = new Token(event.params.tokenId.toString())
    token.tokenID = event.params.tokenId

    token.tokenURI = '/' + event.params.tokenId.toString() + '.json'
    const tokenIpfsHash = ipfshash + token.tokenURI
    //This creates a path to the metadata for a single Crypto coven NFT. It concats the directory with "/" + filename + ".json"

    token.ipfsURI = tokenIpfsHash

    TokenMetadataTemplate.create(tokenIpfsHash)
  }

  token.updatedAtTimestamp = event.block.timestamp
  token.owner = event.params.to.toHexString()
  token.save()
}
```

这将创建一个新的文件数据源，该数据源将轮询Graph Node配置的IPFS或Arweave端点，如果未找到文件，则进行重试。当找到文件时，文件数据源处理程序将被执行。

This example is using the CID as the lookup between the parent `Token` entity and the resulting `TokenMetadata` entity.

> Previously, this is the point at which a subgraph developer would have called `ipfs.cat(CID)` to fetch the file

祝贺您，您正在使用文件数据源！

#### 将你的子图部署

You can now `build` and `deploy` your subgraph to any Graph Node >=v0.30.0-rc.0.

#### 限制

文件数据源处理程序和实体与其他子图实体隔离，确保它们在执行时是确定的，并确保基于链的数据源不受污染。具体来说:

- 文件数据源创建的实体是不可变的，不能更新
- 文件数据源处理程序无法访问其他文件数据源中的实体
- 基于链的处理程序无法访问与文件数据源关联的实体

> 虽然这个约束对于大多数用例不应该是有问题的，但是对于某些用例，它可能会引入复杂性。如果您在子图中基于文件数据建模时遇到问题，请通过 Discord 与我们联系！

此外，不可能从文件数据源创建数据源，无论是线上数据源还是其他文件数据源。这项限制将来可能会取消。

#### 最佳实践

如果要将 NFT 元数据链接到相应的代币，请使用元数据的 IPFS hash从代币实体引用元数据实体。使用 IPFS hash作为 ID 保存元数据实体。

You can use [DataSource context](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/api/#entity-and-datasourcecontext) when creating File Data Sources to pass extra information which will be available to the File Data Source handler.

If you have entities which are refreshed multiple times, create unique file-based entities using the IPFS hash & the entity ID, and reference them using a derived field in the chain-based entity.

> 我们正在努力改进上述建议，因此查询只返回“最新”版本。

#### 已知问题

File data sources currently require ABIs, even though ABIs are not used ([issue](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli/issues/961)). Workaround is to add any ABI.

Handlers for File Data Sources cannot be in files which import `eth_call` contract bindings, failing with "unknown import: `ethereum::ethereum.call` has not been defined" ([issue](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/issues/4309)). Workaround is to create file data source handlers in a dedicated file.

## Indexed Argument Filters / Topic Filters

> **Requires**: [SpecVersion](#specversion-releases) >= `1.2.0`

Topic filters, also known as indexed argument filters, are a powerful feature in subgraphs that allow users to precisely filter blockchain events based on the values of their indexed arguments.

- These filters help isolate specific events of interest from the vast stream of events on the blockchain, allowing subgraphs to operate more efficiently by focusing only on relevant data.

- This is useful for creating personal subgraphs that track specific addresses and their interactions with various smart contracts on the blockchain.

### How Topic Filters Work

When a smart contract emits an event, any arguments that are marked as indexed can be used as filters in a subgraph's manifest. This allows the subgraph to listen selectively for events that match these indexed arguments.

- The event's first indexed argument corresponds to `topic1`, the second to `topic2`, and so on, up to `topic3`, since the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allows up to three indexed arguments per event.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Token {
    // Event declaration with indexed parameters for addresses
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    // Function to simulate transferring tokens
    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public {
        // Emitting the Transfer event with from, to, and value
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Transfer` event is used to log transactions of tokens between addresses.
- The `from` and `to` parameters are indexed, allowing event listeners to filter and monitor transfers involving specific addresses.
- The `transfer` function is a simple representation of a token transfer action, emitting the Transfer event whenever it is called.

#### Configuration in Subgraphs

Topic filters are defined directly within the event handler configuration in the subgraph manifest. Here is how they are configured:

```yaml
eventHandlers:
  - event: SomeEvent(indexed uint256, indexed address, indexed uint256)
    handler: handleSomeEvent
    topic1: ['0xValue1', '0xValue2']
    topic2: ['0xAddress1', '0xAddress2']
    topic3: ['0xValue3']
```

In this setup:

- `topic1` corresponds to the first indexed argument of the event, `topic2` to the second, and `topic3` to the third.
- Each topic can have one or more values, and an event is only processed if it matches one of the values in each specified topic.

#### Filter Logic

- Within a Single Topic: The logic functions as an OR condition. The event will be processed if it matches any one of the listed values in a given topic.
- Between Different Topics: The logic functions as an AND condition. An event must satisfy all specified conditions across different topics to trigger the associated handler.

#### Example 1: Tracking Direct Transfers from Address A to Address B

```yaml
eventHandlers:
  - event: Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,uint256)
    handler: handleDirectedTransfer
    topic1: ['0xAddressA'] # Sender Address
    topic2: ['0xAddressB'] # Receiver Address
```

In this configuration:

- `topic1` is configured to filter `Transfer` events where `0xAddressA` is the sender.
- `topic2` is configured to filter `Transfer` events where `0xAddressB` is the receiver.
- The subgraph will only index transactions that occur directly from `0xAddressA` to `0xAddressB`.

#### Example 2: Tracking Transactions in Either Direction Between Two or More Addresses

```yaml
eventHandlers:
  - event: Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,uint256)
    handler: handleTransferToOrFrom
    topic1: ['0xAddressA', '0xAddressB', '0xAddressC'] # Sender Address
    topic2: ['0xAddressB', '0xAddressC'] # Receiver Address
```

In this configuration:

- `topic1` is configured to filter `Transfer` events where `0xAddressA`, `0xAddressB`, `0xAddressC` is the sender.
- `topic2` is configured to filter `Transfer` events where `0xAddressB` and `0xAddressC` is the receiver.
- The subgraph will index transactions that occur in either direction between multiple addresses allowing for comprehensive monitoring of interactions involving all addresses.

## Declared eth_call

> Note: This is an experimental feature that is not currently available in a stable Graph Node release yet. You can only use it in Subgraph Studio or your self-hosted node.

Declarative `eth_calls` are a valuable subgraph feature that allows `eth_calls` to be executed ahead of time, enabling `graph-node` to execute them in parallel.

This feature does the following:

- Significantly improves the performance of fetching data from the Ethereum blockchain by reducing the total time for multiple calls and optimizing the subgraph's overall efficiency.
- Allows faster data fetching, resulting in quicker query responses and a better user experience.
- Reduces wait times for applications that need to aggregate data from multiple Ethereum calls, making the data retrieval process more efficient.

### Key Concepts

- Declarative `eth_calls`: Ethereum calls that are defined to be executed in parallel rather than sequentially.
- Parallel Execution: Instead of waiting for one call to finish before starting the next, multiple calls can be initiated simultaneously.
- Time Efficiency: The total time taken for all the calls changes from the sum of the individual call times (sequential) to the time taken by the longest call (parallel).

#### Scenario without Declarative `eth_calls`

Imagine you have a subgraph that needs to make three Ethereum calls to fetch data about a user's transactions, balance, and token holdings.

Traditionally, these calls might be made sequentially:

1. Call 1 (Transactions): Takes 3 seconds
2. Call 2 (Balance): Takes 2 seconds
3. Call 3 (Token Holdings): Takes 4 seconds

Total time taken = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 seconds

#### Scenario with Declarative `eth_calls`

With this feature, you can declare these calls to be executed in parallel:

1. Call 1 (Transactions): Takes 3 seconds
2. Call 2 (Balance): Takes 2 seconds
3. Call 3 (Token Holdings): Takes 4 seconds

Since these calls are executed in parallel, the total time taken is equal to the time taken by the longest call.

Total time taken = max (3, 2, 4) = 4 seconds

#### How it Works

1. Declarative Definition: In the subgraph manifest, you declare the Ethereum calls in a way that indicates they can be executed in parallel.
2. Parallel Execution Engine: The Graph Node's execution engine recognizes these declarations and runs the calls simultaneously.
3. Result Aggregation: Once all calls are complete, the results are aggregated and used by the subgraph for further processing.

#### Example Configuration in Subgraph Manifest

Declared `eth_calls` can access the `event.address` of the underlying event as well as all the `event.params`.

`Subgraph.yaml` using `event.address`:

```yaml
eventHandlers:
event: Swap(indexed address,indexed address,int256,int256,uint160,uint128,int24)
handler: handleSwap
calls:
  global0X128: Pool[event.address].feeGrowthGlobal0X128()
  global1X128: Pool[event.address].feeGrowthGlobal1X128()
```

Details for the example above:

- `global0X128` is the declared `eth_call`.
- The text (`global0X128`) is the label for this `eth_call` which is used when logging errors.
- The text (`Pool[event.address].feeGrowthGlobal0X128()`) is the actual `eth_call` that will be executed, which is in the form of `Contract[address].function(arguments)`
- The `address` and `arguments` can be replaced with variables that will be available when the handler is executed.

`Subgraph.yaml` using `event.params`

```yaml
calls:
  - ERC20DecimalsToken0: ERC20[event.params.token0].decimals()
```

### 嫁接到现有子图

> **Note:** it is not recommended to use grafting when initially upgrading to The Graph Network. Learn more [here](/subgraphs/cookbook/grafting/#important-note-on-grafting-when-upgrading-to-the-network).

When a subgraph is first deployed, it starts indexing events at the genesis block of the corresponding chain (or at the `startBlock` defined with each data source) In some circumstances; it is beneficial to reuse the data from an existing subgraph and start indexing at a much later block. This mode of indexing is called _Grafting_. Grafting is, for example, useful during development to get past simple errors in the mappings quickly or to temporarily get an existing subgraph working again after it has failed.

A subgraph is grafted onto a base subgraph when the subgraph manifest in `subgraph.yaml` contains a `graft` block at the top-level:

```yaml
description: ...
graft:
  base: Qm... # Subgraph ID of base subgraph
  block: 7345624 # Block number
```

When a subgraph whose manifest contains a `graft` block is deployed, Graph Node will copy the data of the `base` subgraph up to and including the given `block` and then continue indexing the new subgraph from that block on. The base subgraph must exist on the target Graph Node instance and must have indexed up to at least the given block. Because of this restriction, grafting should only be used during development or during an emergency to speed up producing an equivalent non-grafted subgraph.

因为嫁接是拷贝而不是索引基础数据，所以子图同步到所需区块比从头开始索引要快得多，尽管对于非常大的子图，初始数据拷贝仍可能需要几个小时。 在初始化嫁接子图时，Graph 节点将记录有关已复制的实体类型的信息。

嫁接子图可以使用一个 GraphQL 模式 schema，该模式与基子图之一不同，但仅与基子图兼容。它本身必须是一个有效的子图模式，但是可以通过以下方式偏离基子图的模式：

- 它添加或删除实体类型
- 它从实体类型中删除属性
- 它将可为空的属性添加到实体类型
- 它将不可为空的属性转换为可空的属性
- 它将值添加到枚举类型中
- 它添加或删除接口
- 它改变了实现接口的实体类型

> **[Feature Management](#experimental-features):** `grafting` must be declared under `features` in the subgraph manifest.
