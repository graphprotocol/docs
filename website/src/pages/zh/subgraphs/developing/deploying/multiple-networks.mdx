本页介绍如何将子图部署到多个网络。要部署子图，需要首先安装[Graph CLI](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling/tree/main/packages/cli)。如果尚未创建子图，请参见[创建子图](/developing/creating-a-subgraph)。

## 将子图部署到多个网络

在某些情况下，您需要将相同的子图部署到多个网络，而不复制其所有代码。随之而来的主要挑战是这些网络上的合约地址不同。

### 使用`graph-cli`

`graph build`（从`v0.29.0`版本开始）和`graph deploy`（从`v0.32.0`版本开始）都接受两个新选项：

```sh
Options:

      ...
      --network <name>          Network configuration to use from the networks config file
      --network-file <path>     Networks config file path (default: "./networks.json")
```

You can use the `--network` option to specify a network configuration from a `json` standard file (defaults to `networks.json`) to easily update your Subgraph during development.

> Note: The `init` command will now auto-generate a `networks.json` based on the provided information. You will then be able to update existing or add additional networks.

If you don't have a `networks.json` file, you'll need to manually create one with the following structure:

```json
{
    "network1": { // the network name
        "dataSource1": { // the dataSource name
            "address": "0xabc...", // the contract address (optional)
            "startBlock": 123456 // the startBlock (optional)
        },
        "dataSource2": {
            "address": "0x123...",
            "startBlock": 123444
        }
    },
    "network2": {
        "dataSource1": {
            "address": "0x987...",
            "startBlock": 123
        },
        "dataSource2": {
            "address": "0xxyz..",
            "startBlock": 456
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

> Note: You don't have to specify any of the `templates` (if you have any) in the config file, only the `dataSources`. If there are any `templates` declared in the `subgraph.yaml` file, their network will be automatically updated to the one specified with the `--network` option.

Now, let's assume you want to be able to deploy your Subgraph to the `mainnet` and `sepolia` networks, and this is your `subgraph.yaml`:

```yaml
# ...
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Gravity
    network: mainnet
    source:
      address: '0x123...'
      abi: Gravity
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
```

您的网络配置文件应该是这样的:

```json
{
  "mainnet": {
    "Gravity": {
      "address": "0x123..."
    }
  },
  "sepolia": {
    "Gravity": {
      "address": "0xabc..."
    }
  }
}
```

现在我们可以运行以下命令之一:

```sh
# Using default networks.json file
yarn build --network sepolia

# Using custom named file
yarn build --network sepolia --network-file path/to/config
```

The `build` command will update your `subgraph.yaml` with the `sepolia` configuration and then re-compile the Subgraph. Your `subgraph.yaml` file now should look like this:

```yaml
# ...
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Gravity
    network: sepolia
    source:
      address: '0xabc...'
      abi: Gravity
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
```

Now you are ready to `yarn deploy`.

> Note: As mentioned earlier, since `graph-cli 0.32.0` you can directly run `yarn deploy` with the `--network` option:

```sh
# Using default networks.json file
yarn deploy --network sepolia

# Using custom named file
yarn deploy --network sepolia --network-file path/to/config
```

### 使用 subgraph.yaml 模板

One way to parameterize aspects like contract addresses using older `graph-cli` versions is to generate parts of it with a templating system like [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) or [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).

To illustrate this approach, let's assume a Subgraph should be deployed to mainnet and Sepolia using different contract addresses. You could then define two config files providing the addresses for each network:

```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "address": "0x123..."
}
```

和

```json
{
  "network": "sepolia",
  "address": "0xabc..."
}
```

Along with that, you would substitute the network name and addresses in the manifest with variable placeholders `{{network}}` and `{{address}}` and rename the manifest to e.g. `subgraph.template.yaml`:

```yaml
# ...
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Gravity
    network: mainnet
    network: {{network}}
    source:
      address: '0x2E645469f354BB4F5c8a05B3b30A929361cf77eC'
      address: '{{address}}'
      abi: Gravity
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
```

In order to generate a manifest to either network, you could add two additional commands to `package.json` along with a dependency on `mustache`:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "prepare:mainnet": "mustache config/mainnet.json subgraph.template.yaml > subgraph.yaml",
    "prepare:sepolia": "mustache config/sepolia.json subgraph.template.yaml > subgraph.yaml"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    ...
    "mustache": "^3.1.0"
  }
}
```

To deploy this Subgraph for mainnet or Sepolia you would now simply run one of the two following commands:

```sh
# Mainnet:
yarn prepare:mainnet && yarn deploy

# Sepolia:
yarn prepare:sepolia && yarn deploy
```

A working example of this can be found [here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph/tree/371232cf68e6d814facf5e5413ad0fef65144759).

**Note:** This approach can also be applied to more complex situations, where it is necessary to substitute more than contract addresses and network names or where generating mappings or ABIs from templates as well.

This will give you the `chainHeadBlock` which you can compare with the `latestBlock` on your Subgraph to check if it is running behind. `synced` informs if the Subgraph has ever caught up to the chain. `health` can currently take the values of `healthy` if no errors occurred, or `failed` if there was an error which halted the progress of the Subgraph. In this case, you can check the `fatalError` field for details on this error.

## Subgraph Studio Subgraph archive policy

A Subgraph version in Studio is archived if and only if it meets the following criteria:

- The version is not published to the network (or pending publish)
- The version was created 45 or more days ago
- The Subgraph hasn't been queried in 30 days

In addition, when a new version is deployed, if the Subgraph has not been published, then the N-2 version of the Subgraph is archived.

Every Subgraph affected with this policy has an option to bring the version in question back.

## Checking Subgraph health

If a Subgraph syncs successfully, that is a good sign that it will continue to run well forever. However, new triggers on the network might cause your Subgraph to hit an untested error condition or it may start to fall behind due to performance issues or issues with the node operators.

Graph Node exposes a GraphQL endpoint which you can query to check the status of your Subgraph. On the hosted service, it is available at `https://api.thegraph.com/index-node/graphql`. On a local node, it is available on port `8030/graphql` by default. The full schema for this endpoint can be found [here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/server/index-node/src/schema.graphql). Here is an example query that checks the status of the current version of a Subgraph:

```graphql
{
  indexingStatusForCurrentVersion(subgraphName: "org/subgraph") {
    synced
    health
    fatalError {
      message
      block {
        number
        hash
      }
      handler
    }
    chains {
      chainHeadBlock {
        number
      }
      latestBlock {
        number
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will give you the `chainHeadBlock` which you can compare with the `latestBlock` on your Subgraph to check if it is running behind. `synced` informs if the Subgraph has ever caught up to the chain. `health` can currently take the values of `healthy` if no errors occurred, or `failed` if there was an error which halted the progress of the Subgraph. In this case, you can check the `fatalError` field for details on this error.
