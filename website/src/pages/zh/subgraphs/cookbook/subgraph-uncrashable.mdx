[Subgraph Uncrashable](https://float-capital.github.io/float-subgraph-uncrashable/) is a code generation tool that generates a set of helper functions from the graphql schema of a project. It ensures that all interactions with entities in your subgraph are completely safe and consistent.

## 为什么要整合子图使其不崩溃？

- **Continuous Uptime**. Mishandled entities may cause subgraphs to crash, which can be disruptive for projects that are dependent on The Graph. Set up helper functions to make your subgraphs “uncrashable” and ensure business continuity.

- **Completely Safe**. Common problems seen in subgraph development are issues of loading undefined entities, not setting or initializing all values of entities, and race conditions on loading and saving entities. Ensure all interactions with entities are completely atomic.

- **User Configurable** Set default values and configure the level of security checks that suits your individual project's needs. Warning logs are recorded indicating where there is a breach of subgraph logic to help patch the issue to ensure data accuracy.

**Key Features**

- The code generation tool accommodates **all** subgraph types and is configurable for users to set sane defaults on values. The code generation will use this config to generate helper functions that are to the users specification.

- 该框架还包括一种方法(通过配置文件) 为实体变量组创建自定义但安全的 setter 函数。这样，用户就不可能加载/使用过时的图形实体，也不可能忘记保存或设置函数所需的变量。

- Warning logs are recorded as logs indicating where there is a breach of subgraph logic to help patch the issue to ensure data accuracy.

使用 Graph CLI codegen 命令，Subgraph Uncrashable 可以作为一个可选标志运行。

```sh
graph codegen -u [options] [<subgraph-manifest>]
```
