title: 在 NEAR 上构建子图
---

This guide is an introduction to building subgraphs indexing smart contracts on the [NEAR blockchain](https://docs.near.org/).

## What is NEAR?

[NEAR](https://near.org/) is a smart contract platform for building decentralized applications. Visit the [official documentation](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/protocol) for more information.

## What are NEAR subgraphs?

The Graph gives developers tools to process blockchain events and make the resulting data easily available via a GraphQL API, known individually as a subgraph. [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) is now able to process NEAR events, which means that NEAR developers can now build subgraphs to index their smart contracts.

Subgraphs are event-based, which means that they listen for and then process onchain events. There are currently two types of handlers supported for NEAR subgraphs:

- Block handlers: these are run on every new block
- Receipt handlers: run every time a message is executed at a specified account

[From the NEAR documentation](https://docs.near.org/build/data-infrastructure/lake-data-structures/receipt):

> Receipt 是系统中唯一可操作的对象。 当我们在 NEAR 平台上谈论“处理交易”时，这最终意味着在某个时候“应用收据”。

## 构建 NEAR 子图

`@graphprotocol/graph-cli` is a command-line tool for building and deploying subgraphs.

`@graphprotocol/graph-ts` is a library of subgraph-specific types.

NEAR subgraph development requires `graph-cli` above version `0.23.0`, and `graph-ts` above version `0.23.0`.

> 构建 NEAR 子图与构建索引以太坊的子图非常相似。

子图定义包括三个方面：

**subgraph.yaml:** the subgraph manifest, defining the data sources of interest, and how they should be processed. NEAR is a new `kind` of data source.

**schema.graphql:** a schema file that defines what data is stored for your subgraph, and how to query it via GraphQL. The requirements for NEAR subgraphs are covered by [the existing documentation](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#the-graphql-schema).

**AssemblyScript Mappings:** [AssemblyScript code](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/api/) that translates from the event data to the entities defined in your schema. NEAR support introduces NEAR-specific data types and new JSON parsing functionality.

在子图开发过程中，有两个关键命令：

```bash
$ graph codegen # 从清单中标识的模式文件生成类型
$ graph build # 从 AssemblyScript 文件生成 Web Assembly，并在 /build 文件夹中准备所有子图文件
```

### 子图清单定义

The subgraph manifest (`subgraph.yaml`) identifies the data sources for the subgraph, the triggers of interest, and the functions that should be run in response to those triggers. See below for an example subgraph manifest for a NEAR subgraph:

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.2
schema:
  file: ./src/schema.graphql # link to the schema file
dataSources:
  - kind: near
    network: near-mainnet
    source:
      account: app.good-morning.near # This data source will monitor this account
      startBlock: 10662188 # Required for NEAR
    mapping:
      apiVersion: 0.0.5
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      blockHandlers:
        - handler: handleNewBlock # the function name in the mapping file
      receiptHandlers:
        - handler: handleReceipt # the function name in the mapping file
      file: ./src/mapping.ts # link to the file with the Assemblyscript mappings
```

- NEAR subgraphs introduce a new `kind` of data source (`near`)
- The `network` should correspond to a network on the hosting Graph Node. On Subgraph Studio, NEAR's mainnet is `near-mainnet`, and NEAR's testnet is `near-testnet`
- NEAR data sources introduce an optional `source.account` field, which is a human-readable ID corresponding to a [NEAR account](https://docs.near.org/concepts/protocol/account-model). This can be an account or a sub-account.
- NEAR data sources introduce an alternative optional `source.accounts` field, which contains optional suffixes and prefixes. At least prefix or suffix must be specified, they will match the any account starting or ending with the list of values respectively. The example below would match: `[app|good].*[morning.near|morning.testnet]`. If only a list of prefixes or suffixes is necessary the other field can be omitted.

```yaml
accounts:
  prefixes:
    - app
    - good
  suffixes:
    - morning.near
    - morning.testnet
```

NEAR data sources support two types of handlers:

- `blockHandlers`: run on every new NEAR block. No `source.account` is required.
- `receiptHandlers`: run on every receipt where the data source's `source.account` is the recipient. Note that only exact matches are processed ([subaccounts](https://docs.near.org/tutorials/crosswords/basics/add-functions-call#create-a-subaccount) must be added as independent data sources).

### 模式定义

Schema definition describes the structure of the resulting subgraph database and the relationships between entities. This is agnostic of the original data source. There are more details on subgraph schema definition [here](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#the-graphql-schema).

### AssemblyScript 映射

The handlers for processing events are written in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/).

NEAR indexing introduces NEAR-specific data types to the [AssemblyScript API](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/api/).

```typescript

class ExecutionOutcome {
      gasBurnt: u64,
      blockHash: Bytes,
      id: Bytes,
      logs: Array<string>,
      receiptIds: Array<Bytes>,
      tokensBurnt: BigInt,
      executorId: string,
  }

class ActionReceipt {
      predecessorId: string,
      receiverId: string,
      id: CryptoHash,
      signerId: string,
      gasPrice: BigInt,
      outputDataReceivers: Array<DataReceiver>,
      inputDataIds: Array<CryptoHash>,
      actions: Array<ActionValue>,
  }

class BlockHeader {
      height: u64,
      prevHeight: u64,// Always zero when version < V3
      epochId: Bytes,
      nextEpochId: Bytes,
      chunksIncluded: u64,
      hash: Bytes,
      prevHash: Bytes,
      timestampNanosec: u64,
      randomValue: Bytes,
      gasPrice: BigInt,
      totalSupply: BigInt,
      latestProtocolVersion: u32,
  }

class ChunkHeader {
      gasUsed: u64,
      gasLimit: u64,
      shardId: u64,
      chunkHash: Bytes,
      prevBlockHash: Bytes,
      balanceBurnt: BigInt,
  }

class Block {
      author: string,
      header: BlockHeader,
      chunks: Array<ChunkHeader>,
  }

class ReceiptWithOutcome {
      outcome: ExecutionOutcome,
      receipt: ActionReceipt,
      block: Block,
  }
```

These types are passed to block & receipt handlers:

- Block handlers will receive a `Block`
- Receipt handlers will receive a `ReceiptWithOutcome`

Otherwise, the rest of the [AssemblyScript API](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/api/) is available to NEAR subgraph developers during mapping execution.

This includes a new JSON parsing function - logs on NEAR are frequently emitted as stringified JSONs. A new `json.fromString(...)` function is available as part of the [JSON API](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/api/#json-api) to allow developers to easily process these logs.

## 部署 NEAR 子图

Once you have a built subgraph, it is time to deploy it to Graph Node for indexing. NEAR subgraphs can be deployed to any Graph Node `>=v0.26.x` (this version has not yet been tagged & released).

Subgraph Studio and the upgrade Indexer on The Graph Network currently supports indexing NEAR mainnet and testnet in beta, with the following network names:

- `near-mainnet`
- `near-testnet`

More information on creating and deploying subgraphs on Subgraph Studio can be found [here](/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio/).

As a quick primer - the first step is to "create" your subgraph - this only needs to be done once. On Subgraph Studio, this can be done from [your Dashboard](https://thegraph.com/studio/): "Create a subgraph".

Once your subgraph has been created, you can deploy your subgraph by using the `graph deploy` CLI command:

```sh
$ graph create --node <graph-node-url> <subgraph-name> # creates a subgraph on a local Graph Node (on Subgraph Studio, this is done via the UI)
$ graph deploy --node <graph-node-url> --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/ <subgraph-name> # uploads the build files to a specified IPFS endpoint, and then deploys the subgraph to a specified Graph Node based on the manifest IPFS hash
```

节点配置将取决于子图的部署位置。

### 子图工作室

```sh
graph auth
graph deploy <subgraph-name>
```

### 本地Graph节点（基于默认配置）

```sh
graph deploy --node http://localhost:8020/ --ipfs http://localhost:5001 <subgraph-name>
```

部署子图后，它将由 Graph节点索引。 您可以通过查询子图本身来检查其进度：

```graphql
{
  _meta {
    block {
      number
    }
  }
}
```

### 使用本地Graph节点索引 NEAR

运行索引 NEAR 的 Graph节点有以下操作要求：

- 带有 Firehose 工具的 NEAR 索引人框架
- NEAR Firehose 组件
- 配置了 Firehose 端点的Graph节点

我们将很快提供有关运行上述组件的更多信息。

## 查询 NEAR 子图

The GraphQL endpoint for NEAR subgraphs is determined by the schema definition, with the existing API interface. Please visit the [GraphQL API documentation](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/) for more information.

## 示例子图

Here are some example subgraphs for reference:

## FAQ

### 测试版是如何工作的？

NEAR 支持处于测试阶段，这意味着随着我们继续致力于改进集成，API 可能会发生变化。 请发送电子邮件至 near@thegraph.com，以便我们支持您构建 NEAR 子图，并让您了解最新进展！

### 子图可以同时索引 NEAR 和 EVM 链吗？

不，子图只能支持来自一个链/网络的数据源。

### 子图可以对更具体的触发器做出反应吗？

目前，仅支持 Block 和 Receipt 触发器。 我们正在调查对指定帐户的函数调用的触发器。 一旦 NEAR 拥有原生事件支持，我们也对支持事件触发器感兴趣。

### 接受处理程序会触发账户及其子账户吗？

If an `account` is specified, that will only match the exact account name. It is possible to match sub-accounts by specifying an `accounts` field, with `suffixes` and `prefixes` specified to match accounts and sub-accounts, for example the following would match all `mintbase1.near` sub-accounts:

```yaml
accounts:
  suffixes:
    - mintbase1.near
```

### NEAR 子图可以在映射期间对 NEAR 帐户进行视图调用吗？

这是不支持的。 我们正在评估索引是否需要此功能。

### 我可以在 NEAR 子图中使用数据源模板吗？

目前不支持此功能。 我们正在评估索引是否需要此功能。

### 以太坊子图支持“待定”和“当前”版本，如何部署 NEAR 子图的“待定”版本？

NEAR 子图尚不支持挂起的功能。 在此期间，您可以将新版本部署到不同的“命名”子图，然后当它与链头同步时，您可以重新部署到您的主“命名”子图，它将使用相同的底层部署 ID，所以 主子图将立即同步。

### 我的问题尚未得到解答，在哪里可以获得更多构建 NEAR 子图的帮助？

If it is a general question about subgraph development, there is a lot more information in the rest of the [Developer documentation](/subgraphs/quick-start/). Otherwise please join [The Graph Protocol Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol) and ask in the #near channel or email near@thegraph.com.
