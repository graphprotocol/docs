Learn about the GraphQL Query API used in The Graph.

## What is GraphQL?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. The Graph uses GraphQL to query subgraphs.

To understand the larger role that GraphQL plays, review [developing](/subgraphs/developing/introduction/) and [creating a subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

## Queries with GraphQL

In your subgraph schema you define types called `Entities`. For each `Entity` type, `entity` and `entities` fields will be generated on the top-level `Query` type.

> Note: `query` does not need to be included at the top of the `graphql` query when using The Graph.

### 例子

Query for a single `Token` entity defined in your schema:

```graphql
{
  token(id: "1") {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

> Note: When querying for a single entity, the `id` field is required, and it must be written as a string.

Query all `Token` entities:

```graphql
{
  tokens {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

### 排序

When querying a collection, you may:

- Use the `orderBy` parameter to sort by a specific attribute.
- Use the `orderDirection` to specify the sort direction, `asc` for ascending or `desc` for descending.

#### 示例

```graphql
{
  tokens(orderBy: price, orderDirection: asc) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

#### 嵌套实体筛选示例

As of Graph Node [`v0.30.0`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases/tag/v0.30.0) entities can be sorted on the basis of nested entities.

The following example shows tokens sorted by the name of their owner:

```graphql
{
  tokens(orderBy: owner__name, orderDirection: asc) {
    id
    owner {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

> Currently, you can sort by one-level deep `String` or `ID` types on `@entity` and `@derivedFrom` fields. Unfortunately, [sorting by interfaces on one level-deep entities](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/pull/4058), sorting by fields which are arrays and nested entities is not yet supported.

### 分页

When querying a collection, it's best to:

- Use the `first` parameter to paginate from the beginning of the collection.
  - The default sort order is by `ID` in ascending alphanumeric order, **not** by creation time.
- Use the `skip` parameter to skip entities and paginate. For instance, `first:100` shows the first 100 entities and `first:100, skip:100` shows the next 100 entities.
- Avoid using `skip` values in queries because they generally perform poorly. To retrieve a large number of items, it's best to page through entities based on an attribute as shown in the previous example above.

#### Example using `first`

查询前10 个代币：

```graphql
{
  tokens(first: 10) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

To query for groups of entities in the middle of a collection, the `skip` parameter may be used in conjunction with the `first` parameter to skip a specified number of entities starting at the beginning of the collection.

#### Example using `first` and `skip`

Query 10 `Token` entities, offset by 10 places from the beginning of the collection:

```graphql
{
  tokens(first: 10, skip: 10) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

#### Example using `first` and `id_ge`

If a client needs to retrieve a large number of entities, it's more performant to base queries on an attribute and filter by that attribute. For example, a client could retrieve a large number of tokens using this query:

```graphql
query manyTokens($lastID: String) {    tokens(first: 1000, where: { id_gt: $lastID }) {
      id
      owner
    }
  }
}
```

The first time, it would send the query with `lastID = ""`, and for subsequent requests it would set `lastID` to the `id` attribute of the last entity in the previous request. This approach will perform significantly better than using increasing `skip` values.

### 过滤

- You can use the `where` parameter in your queries to filter for different properties.
- You can filter on multiple values within the `where` parameter.

#### Example using `where`

Query challenges with `failed` outcome:

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { outcome: "failed" }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

You can use suffixes like `_gt`, `_lte` for value comparison:

#### 范围过滤示例

```graphql
{
  applications(where: { deposit_gt: "10000000000" }) {
    id
    whitelisted
    deposit
  }
}
```

#### 区块过滤示例

You can also filter entities that were updated in or after a specified block with `_change_block(number_gte: Int)`.

如果您只想获取已经更改的实体，例如自上次轮询以来改变的实体，那么这将非常有用。或者也可以调查或调试子图中实体的变化情况(如果与区块过滤器结合使用，则只能隔离在特定区块中发生变化的实体)。

```graphql
{
  applications(where: { _change_block: { number_gte: 100 } }) {
    id
    whitelisted
    deposit
  }
}
```

#### 嵌套实体筛选示例

Filtering on the basis of nested entities is possible in the fields with the `_` suffix.

如果您希望只获取其子级实体满足条件的实体，那么这可能很有用。

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { application_: { id: 1 } }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

#### 逻辑运算符

As of Graph Node [`v0.30.0`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases/tag/v0.30.0) you can group multiple parameters in the same `where` argument using the `and` or the `or` operators to filter results based on more than one criteria.

##### `AND` Operator

The following example filters for challenges with `outcome` `succeeded` and `number` greater than or equal to `100`.

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { and: [{ number_gte: 100 }, { outcome: "succeeded" }] }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

> **Syntactic sugar:** You can simplify the above query by removing the `and` operator by passing a sub-expression separated by commas.
>
> ```graphql
> {
>   challenges(where: { number_gte: 100, outcome: "succeeded" }) {
>     challenger
>     outcome
>     application {
>       id
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

##### `OR` Operator

The following example filters for challenges with `outcome` `succeeded` or `number` greater than or equal to `100`.

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { or: [{ number_gte: 100 }, { outcome: "succeeded" }] }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: When constructing queries, it is important to consider the performance impact of using the `or` operator. While `or` can be a useful tool for broadening search results, it can also have significant costs. One of the main issues with `or` is that it can cause queries to slow down. This is because `or` requires the database to scan through multiple indexes, which can be a time-consuming process. To avoid these issues, it is recommended that developers use and operators instead of or whenever possible. This allows for more precise filtering and can lead to faster, more accurate queries.

#### 所有过滤器

_ends_with
_ends_with_nocase
_not_starts_with
_not_starts_with_nocase
_not_ends_with

```

> Please note that some suffixes are only supported for specific types. For example, `Boolean` only supports `_not`, `_in`, and `_not_in`, but `_` is available only for object and interface types.

In addition, the following global filters are available as part of `where` argument:

```graphql
_change_block(number_gte: Int)
```

### 跨时间查询

You can query the state of your entities not just for the latest block, which is the default, but also for an arbitrary block in the past. The block at which a query should happen can be specified either by its block number or its block hash by including a `block` argument in the toplevel fields of queries.

The result of such a query will not change over time, i.e., querying at a certain past block will return the same result no matter when it is executed, with the exception that if you query at a block very close to the head of the chain, the result might change if that block turns out to **not** be on the main chain and the chain gets reorganized. Once a block can be considered final, the result of the query will not change.

> Note: The current implementation is still subject to certain limitations that might violate these guarantees. The implementation can not always tell that a given block hash is not on the main chain at all, or if a query result by a block hash for a block that is not yet considered final could be influenced by a block reorganization running concurrently with the query. They do not affect the results of queries by block hash when the block is final and known to be on the main chain. [This issue](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/issues/1405) explains what these limitations are in detail.

#### 示例

```graphql
{
  challenges(block: { number: 8000000 }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return `Challenge` entities, and their associated `Application` entities, as they existed directly after processing block number 8,000,000.

#### 示例

```graphql
{
  challenges(block: { hash: "0x5a0b54d5dc17e0aadc383d2db43b0a0d3e029c4c" }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return `Challenge` entities, and their associated `Application` entities, as they existed directly after processing the block with the given hash.

### 全文搜索查询

Fulltext search query fields provide an expressive text search API that can be added to the subgraph schema and customized. Refer to [Defining Fulltext Search Fields](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#defining-fulltext-search-fields) to add fulltext search to your subgraph.

Fulltext search queries have one required field, `text`, for supplying search terms. Several special fulltext operators are available to be used in this `text` search field.

全文搜索运算符：

| 符号   | 运算符      | 描述                                                                   |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `&`    | `And`       | 用于将多个搜索词组合到包含所有提供词条的实体的过滤器中                 |
| &#x7c; | `Or`        | 由 or 运算符分隔的多个搜索词的查询，将返回与任何提供的词匹配的所有实体 |
| `<->`  | `Follow by` | 指定两个单词之间的距离。                                               |
| `:*`   | `Prefix`    | 使用前缀搜索词查找前缀匹配的单词（需要 2 个字符）                      |

#### 例子

Using the `or` operator, this query will filter to blog entities with variations of either "anarchism" or "crumpet" in their fulltext fields.

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "anarchism | crumpets") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

The `follow by` operator specifies a words a specific distance apart in the fulltext documents. The following query will return all blogs with variations of "decentralize" followed by "philosophy"

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "decentralized <-> philosophy") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

可以将全文运算符进行组合来制作更复杂的过滤器。 在下面的查询示例中，使用前缀搜索运算符与其他运算符的结合，可以实现匹配所有以“lou”开头后，跟着“music”单词的日志实体。

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "lou:* <-> music") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

### 验证

Graph Node implements [specification-based](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Validation) validation of the GraphQL queries it receives using [graphql-tools-rs](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-tools-rs#validation-rules), which is based on the [graphql-js reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/main/src/validation). Queries which fail a validation rule do so with a standard error - visit the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Validation) to learn more.

## 模式

The schema of your dataSources, i.e. the entity types, values, and relationships that are available to query, are defined through the [GraphQL Interface Definition Language (IDL)](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec-Type-System).

GraphQL schemas generally define root types for `queries`, `subscriptions` and `mutations`. The Graph only supports `queries`. The root `Query` type for your subgraph is automatically generated from the GraphQL schema that's included in your [subgraph manifest](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#components-of-a-subgraph).

> Note: Our API does not expose mutations because developers are expected to issue transactions directly against the underlying blockchain from their applications.

### 实体

All GraphQL types with `@entity` directives in your schema will be treated as entities and must have an `ID` field.

> **Note:** Currently, all types in your schema must have an `@entity` directive. In the future, we will treat types without an `@entity` directive as value objects, but this is not yet supported.

### 子图元数据

All subgraphs have an auto-generated `_Meta_` object, which provides access to subgraph metadata. This can be queried as follows:

```graphQL
{
  _meta(block: { number: 123987 }) {
    block {
      number
      hash
      timestamp
    }
    deployment
    hasIndexingErrors
  }
}
```

如果提供了区块，则元数据为该区块的元数据，如果未使用最新的索引区块。如果提供，则区块必须在子图的起始区块之后，并且小于或等于最近索引的区块。

`deployment` is a unique ID, corresponding to the IPFS CID of the `subgraph.yaml` file.

`block` provides information about the latest block (taking into account any block constraints passed to `_meta`):

- hash：区块的哈希
- number：区块编号
- timestamp：区块的时间戳（如果可用）（当前仅适用于索引EVM网络的子图）

`hasIndexingErrors` is a boolean identifying whether the subgraph encountered indexing errors at some past block
