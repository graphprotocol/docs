To start querying right away, visit [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer). This guide shows you how to find a [Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/), generate a unique URL, and run queries.

## 概述

Querying a Subgraph with The Graph lets you access onchain data in a fast, reliable, and structured way, without running your own indexing infrastructure. This guide shows you how to get started so you can power your dapp or analysis with blockchain data.

## 步骤

### Step 1: Locate Your Subgraph

After a Subgraph is published to The Graph Network, you can visit its Subgraph details page on Graph Explorer.

### Step 2: Retrieve the Query URL

On the Subgraph details page, click Query (top right) or scroll down. Each Subgraph published to The Graph Network has a unique query URL in Graph Explorer to make direct queries.

### Step 3: Manage Your API Key

Each query URL requires a valid API key. In [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio), locate the **API Keys** section to create or manage your keys. Learn more about how to use Subgraph Studio [here](/subgraphs/developing/deploying/using-subgraph-studio/).

### Step 4: Check Your Usage Plan

Subgraph Studio用户从免费计划开始，每月可以进行100000次查询。增长计划中提供了其他查询，该计划为其他查询提供了基于使用量的定价，可通过信用卡支付，或通过Arbitrum的GRT支付。您可以在[此处](/subgraphs/billing/)了解更多关于计费的信息。

## Handling Errors

If you encounter 405 errors with a GET request to the Graph Explorer URL, please switch to a POST request instead.
