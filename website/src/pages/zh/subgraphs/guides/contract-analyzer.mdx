# Cana CLI: Quick & Efficient Contract Analysis

**Cana CLI** is a command-line tool that streamlines helpful smart contract metadata analysis specific to subgraph development across multiple EVM-compatible chains.

## 📌 Key Features

- Detect deployment blocks
- Verify source code
- Extract ABIs & event signatures
- Identify proxy and implementation contracts
- Support multiple chains

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Install Cana globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g contract-analyzer
```

Set up a blockchain for analysis:

```bash
cana setup
```

Provide the required block explorer API and block explorer endpoint URL details when prompted.

Running `cana setup` creates a configuration file at `~/.contract-analyzer/config.json`. This file stores your block explorer API credentials, endpoint URLs, and chain selection preferences for future use.

## 🍳 Usage

### 🔹 Chain Selection

Cana supports multiple EVM-compatible chains.

List chains added with:

```bash
cana chains
```

Then select a chain with:

```bash
cana chains --switch <chain>
```

Once a chain is selected, all subsequent contract analases will continue on that chain.

### 🔹 Basic Contract Analysis

Analyze a contract with:

```bash
cana analyze 0xContractAddress
```

or

```bash
cana -a 0xContractAddress
```

This command displays essential contract information in the terminal using a clear, organized format.

### 🔹 Understanding Output

Cana organizes results into the terminal as well as into a structured directory when detailed contract data is successfully retrieved:

```
contracts-analyzed/
└── ContractName_chainName_YYYY-MM-DD/
  ├── contract/            # Folder for individual contract files
  ├── abi.json              # Contract ABI
  └── event-information.json # Event signatures and examples
```

### 🔹 Chain Management

Add and manage chains:

```bash
cana setup       # Add a new chain
cana chains      # List configured chains
cana chains -s <chain> # Swich chains.
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- **Missing Data**: Ensure the contract address is correct, verified on the block explorer, and that your API key has the required permissions.

## ✅ Requirements

- Node.js v16+
- npm v6+
- Block explorer API keys

Keep your contract analyses efficient and well-organized. 🚀
