## Overview

You type a natural language question into the chat interface, such as:

```yaml
'On Uniswap, return the top-10 pools by total value locked in USD.'
```

> [!IMPORTANT] All users can process 10 free queries per user per hour.

> [!NOTE] Disclaimer: By using Graph Assistant, you acknowledge that your requests may be logged and used to improve the performance of the underlying agents. Do not share sensitive, personal, or private information.

### Behind the Scenes

The Assistant:

1. Interprets your intent
2. Maps it to the correct Subgraphs or Token API endpoint
3. Executes optimized queries
4. Returns clean, structured results

You don't need to write queries or understand a Subgraph's schema, you simply ask.

### Example Use Cases

- “Compare daily active users on Aave vs. Compound in May 2025.”

**Token Insights**

- “How many XYZ did I receive between May 1 and May 15?”

**Historical Data Retrieval**
