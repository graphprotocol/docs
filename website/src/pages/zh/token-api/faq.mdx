获取快速答案以便轻松地与The Graph的高性能代币API进行整合和缩放。

## 通用

### Which blockchains are supported by the Token API?

Currently, the Token API supports Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Optimism, Base, Unichain, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, and Solana. A full list of supported networks can be found under the Token API column [here](/supported-networks/).

### Does the Token API support NFTs?

Yes, The Graph Token API currently supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFT token standards, with support for additional NFT standards planned. Endpoints are offered for ownership, collection stats, metadata, sales, holders, and transfer activity.

### Do NFTs include off-chain data?

NFT endpoints currently only include on-chain data. To get off-chain data, use the IPFS or HTTP links included in the NFT item response.

### How do I authenticate requests to the Token API, and why doesn't my API key from The Graph Market work?

Authentication is managed via API tokens obtained through [The Graph Market](https://thegraph.market/). If you're experiencing issues, make sure you're using the API Token generated from the API key, not the API key itself. An API token can be found on The Graph Market dashboard next to each API key. JWT tokens issued by [Pinax](https://pinax.network/en), a core developer of The Graph, are also supported.

### API提供的数据相对于区块链的最新程度如何？

The API provides data up to the latest finalized block. This time varies depending on the blockchain. Improvements to provide data closer to the chain head are planned, and feedback is welcome on [Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol).

### How do I retrieve token prices?

Token prices are available with the Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) endpoints. For a given time period, `"open"` represents the price at the start of the time period, `"high"` represents the highest price during the time period, `"low"` represents the lowest price, and `"close"` represents the price at the end of the time period.

### Does the Token API support historical token data?

The Token API supports historical token balances with the `/historical/balances/evm/{address}` endpoint. You can query historical price data by pool at `/ohlc/pools/evm/{pool}` and by contract at `/ohlc/prices/evm/{contract}`. Historical balances have a similar OHLC format, but return token balances instead of prices.

### What exchanges does the Token API use for token prices?

The Token API currently tracks prices on Uniswap v2, v3, and v4, along with Jupiter, Raydium, and Pump.fun on Solana, with plans to support additional exchanges in the future.

### Does the Token API provide a client SDK or client library?

While an official client SDK is not currently available, please share feedback on any SDKs or integrations you would like to see on [Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol). Community contributions are welcome to use the [OpenAPI document](https://token-api.thegraph.com/openapi) to build and share their own client libraries.

### 未来是否有计划支持更多的区块链？

是的，将来会支持更多的区块链。请分享关于在[Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol)上所需的的反馈。

### Are there plans to support additional use cases?

The Graph ecosystem is actively determining the [roadmap](https://thegraph.com/blog/token-api-the-graph/) for additional use cases. Please provide feedback on specific features you would like prioritized on [Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol).

## MCP / LLM / AI 主题

### LLM查询是否有时限？

Yes. The maximum time limit for each LLM query is 10 seconds.

### 是否有已知的与API共用的 LLM清单？

是的，Cline，Cursor，Claude Desktop 已成功整合到 The Graph 的Token API + MCP 服务器。

除此之外，LLM “工作”是否取决于它是否直接支持 MCP 协议(或拥有兼容的插件/适配器)。

### 我在哪里可以找到MCP客户端？

您可以在 [The Graph的仓库](https://github.com/graphprotocol/mcp-client) 中找到MCP客户端的代码。

### MCP 集成与 Claude/Cline/Cursor 显示了诸如"ENOENT" 或 "服务器断开连接"等错误。我如何解决这个问题？

For "ENOENT" errors, ensure Node.js 18+ is installed and the path to `npx`/`bunx` is correct (consider using full paths in config). "Server disconnected" usually indicates authentication or connectivity issues – verify your `ACCESS_TOKEN` is set correctly and your network allows access to `https://token-api.mcp.thegraph.com/sse`.

### 我是否需要使用 MCP 或工具，如Claude、Cline或Cursor？

不，它们是可选的。MCP 是一个高级功能，允许AI 助手通过子流与 API 接口。 对于标准用法，只需使用您的JWT来调用 REST 端点和任意HTTP客户端。 为方便起见，提供了Claude Desktop、Cline bot 和光标IDE集成，但不需要。

## 高级主题

### I keep seeing a smart contract with addresses like `0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee` and `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000`. What is this?

The address `0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee` is a sentinel (placeholder) address used to represent native tokens in EVM smart contracts. Since native tokens (ETH, BNB, AVAX, etc.) exist at the protocol level rather than as smart contracts, DeFi protocols need a placeholder address when their code expects contract addresses for all tokens. This address represents the native token of whatever chain you're on: ETH on Ethereum and its L2s (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism), BNB on BSC, AVAX on Avalanche, and so forth.

The address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` was introduced in Uniswap v4 for the same purpose.

Because these addresses have an obvious repetitive pattern, they are clearly not randomly generated, as are other blockchain addresses. These accounts are not real accounts, just arbitrarily chosen low-entropy addresses that developers agreed to use.

### 我有403/401错误。是怎么回事？

检查您是否包含了 `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` 页眉和正确且未过期的代币。 常见问题包括使用 API 密钥而不是生成一个新的 JWT， 忘记“Bearer”前缀，使用不正确的代币，或完全省略标题。 请确保您复制JWT，正好像The Graph市场提供的。

### Why am I getting 500 errors?

Networks that are currently or temporarily unavailable on a given endpoint will return a `bad_database_response`, `Endpoint is currently not supported for this network` error. Databases that are in the process of ingestion will produce this response.

### Are there rate limits or usage costs?

During Beta, the Token API has a generous allowance of free usage. There are no specific rate limits, but reasonable throttling exists to prevent abuse. High request volumes may trigger HTTP 429 errors. Monitor official announcements for future pricing changes after Beta.

### What do I do if I notice data inconsistencies in the data returned by the Token API?

If you notice data inconsistencies, please report the issue on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol). Identifying edge cases can help make sure all data is accurate and up-to-date.

### How do I specify a network?

You can query which networks are available with [this endpoint](https://token-api.thegraph.com/networks). Take note that the network IDs differ between the Token API and Subgraphs. For EVM networks, use EVM endpoints with the optional `network_id` parameter (e.g., `mainnet`, `bsc`, `base`, `arbitrum-one`, `optimism`, `polygon`, `unichain`) to target a specific chain. Without this parameter, the API defaults to Ethereum mainnet.

To query Solana, use the SVM endpoints.

### 为什么我只看到10个结果？我怎么能够获得更多的数据？

Endpoints cap output at 10 items by default. Use pagination parameters: `limit` and `page` (1-indexed) to return more results. For example, set `limit=50` to get 50 results, and increment `page` for subsequent batches (e.g., `page=2` for items 51-100).

It is currently possible for the total number of pages to be inexact. This is because the backend provides only an approximation of the number of records in order to improve response time. To avoid getting confused by this approximation, make sure to continue fetching next pages until there is no more data, or the endpoint returns an error.

### 如何获取较早的转账历史？

传输端点默认为30天历史记录。要检索更早的事件，请最多增加180天的`年龄`参数(如，`age=180`可以调用六个月转账记录)。超过180 天的转账记录不能在一次调用中获取。

### 空的`数据'：[]`数组是什么意思？

空数据组意味着没有找到匹配查询的记录——不是错误。 当查询钱包时没有任何代币/转账或与没有持有人的代币合约时发生。 验证您使用了正确的地址和参数。无效的地址格式将触发一个 4xx 错误。

### 为什么JSON响应被包装在一个“data”数组中？

所有 Token API 响应始终都会在顶级`data`数组中产生结果，即使是单个项目。 这种统一设计，处理地址有多个余额或传输的常见情况。 解析时，肯定要索引到 `data` 数组(例如`const results = response.data`)。

### 为什么作为字符串退回代币数量？

Large numeric values (like token amounts or supply) are returned as strings to avoid precision loss, as they often exceed JavaScript's safe integer range. Convert these to big number types for arithmetic operations. Fields like `decimals` are provided as normal numbers to help derive human-readable values.

### 地址应该包含什么格式？

For EVM addresses, the API accepts hex addresses with either 42 or 40 characters, with or without the `0x` prefix. The endpoint is case-insensitive, so both lower and uppercase hex characters work. Ensure EVM addresses are exactly 42 characters, or 40 if you remove the prefix. For contract queries, use the token's contract address. For balance/transfer queries, use the wallet address.

SVM addresses are base58-encoded strings that are typically 32-44 characters long. They contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers. Unlike Ethereum addresses which are hexadecimal and start with "0x", Solana addresses don't have a consistent prefix pattern.

### 除了身份验证外，我是否需要特殊的块头？

虽然建议使用`Accept:application/json`，但这并不是严格要求的，因为API默认返回json。关键标头是`Authorization：Bearer<token>`。确保你对正确的URL发出GET请求，没有尾随斜线或路径拼写错误（例如，使用`/bances/evm/{address}`而不是`/bancel`）。

### Token API 是否是The Graph的 GraphQL 服务的一部分？

不，Token API 是一个单独的RESTify服务。 不同于传统子图，它提供现成的REST 端点(HTTP GET) 以获取通用代币数据。 您无需写入 GraphQL 查询或部署子图。 在这个场景下，它使用 The Graph的基础设施和MCP 与 AI 进行丰富，但你只是与REST 端点交互。
