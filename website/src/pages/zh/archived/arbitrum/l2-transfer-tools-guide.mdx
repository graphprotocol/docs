title: L2 Transfer Tools Guide
---

The Graph has made it easy to move to L2 on Arbitrum One. For each protocol participant, there are a set of L2 Transfer Tools to make transferring to L2 seamless for all network participants. These tools will require you to follow a specific set of steps depending on what you are transferring.

Some frequent questions about these tools are answered in the [L2 Transfer Tools FAQ](/archived/arbitrum/l2-transfer-tools-faq/). The FAQs contain in-depth explanations of how to use the tools, how they work, and things to keep in mind when using them.

## How to transfer your Subgraph to Arbitrum (L2)

## Benefits of transferring your Subgraphs

过去一年里，Graph社区和核心开发人员一直在为迁移到 Arbitrum [做准备](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0031-arbitrum-grt-bridge/3305) 。Arbitrum 是一种二层网络或“L2”区块链，继承了以太坊的安全性，但提供了大幅降低的燃气费用。

When you publish or upgrade your Subgraph to The Graph Network, you're interacting with smart contracts on the protocol and this requires paying for gas using ETH. By moving your Subgraphs to Arbitrum, any future updates to your Subgraph will require much lower gas fees. The lower fees, and the fact that curation bonding curves on L2 are flat, also make it easier for other Curators to curate on your Subgraph, increasing the rewards for Indexers on your Subgraph. This lower-cost environment also makes it cheaper for Indexers to index and serve your Subgraph. Indexing rewards will be increasing on Arbitrum and decreasing on Ethereum mainnet over the coming months, so more and more Indexers will be transferring their stake and setting up their operations on L2.

## Understanding what happens with signal, your L1 Subgraph and query URLs

Transferring a Subgraph to Arbitrum uses the Arbitrum GRT bridge, which in turn uses the native Arbitrum bridge, to send the Subgraph to L2. The "transfer" will deprecate the Subgraph on mainnet and send the information to re-create the Subgraph on L2 using the bridge. It will also include the Subgraph owner's signaled GRT, which must be more than zero for the bridge to accept the transfer.

When you choose to transfer the Subgraph, this will convert all of the Subgraph's curation signal to GRT. This is equivalent to "deprecating" the Subgraph on mainnet. The GRT corresponding to your curation will be sent to L2 together with the Subgraph, where they will be used to mint signal on your behalf.

Other Curators can choose whether to withdraw their fraction of GRT, or also transfer it to L2 to mint signal on the same Subgraph. If a Subgraph owner does not transfer their Subgraph to L2 and manually deprecates it via a contract call, then Curators will be notified and will be able to withdraw their curation.

As soon as the Subgraph is transferred, since all curation is converted to GRT, Indexers will no longer receive rewards for indexing the Subgraph. However, there will be Indexers that will 1) keep serving transferred Subgraphs for 24 hours, and 2) immediately start indexing the Subgraph on L2. Since these Indexers already have the Subgraph indexed, there should be no need to wait for the Subgraph to sync, and it will be possible to query the L2 Subgraph almost immediately.

Queries to the L2 Subgraph will need to be done to a different URL (on `arbitrum-gateway.thegraph.com`), but the L1 URL will continue working for at least 48 hours. After that, the L1 gateway will forward queries to the L2 gateway (for some time), but this will add latency so it is recommended to switch all your queries to the new URL as soon as possible.

## 选择你的 L2 钱包

When you published your Subgraph on mainnet, you used a connected wallet to create the Subgraph, and this wallet owns the NFT that represents this Subgraph and allows you to publish updates.

When transferring the Subgraph to Arbitrum, you can choose a different wallet that will own this Subgraph NFT on L2.

如果你使用的是像 MetaMask 这样的“常规”钱包（外部拥有账户或 EOA，即不是智能合约钱包），那么这是可选的，建议保持与 L1 中相同的所有者地址。

If you're using a smart contract wallet, like a multisig (e.g. a Safe), then choosing a different L2 wallet address is mandatory, as it is most likely that this account only exists on mainnet and you will not be able to make transactions on Arbitrum using this wallet. If you want to keep using a smart contract wallet or multisig, create a new wallet on Arbitrum and use its address as the L2 owner of your Subgraph.

**It is very important to use a wallet address that you control, and that can make transactions on Arbitrum. Otherwise, the Subgraph will be lost and cannot be recovered.**

## 为转移做准备：转移一些 ETH

Transferring the Subgraph involves sending a transaction through the bridge, and then executing another transaction on Arbitrum. The first transaction uses ETH on mainnet, and includes some ETH to pay for gas when the message is received on L2. However, if this gas is insufficient, you will have to retry the transaction and pay for the gas directly on L2 (this is "Step 3: Confirming the transfer" below). This step **must be executed within 7 days of starting the transfer**. Moreover, the second transaction ("Step 4: Finishing the transfer on L2") will be done directly on Arbitrum. For these reasons, you will need some ETH on an Arbitrum wallet. If you're using a multisig or smart contract account, the ETH will need to be in the regular (EOA) wallet that you are using to execute the transactions, not on the multisig wallet itself.

你可以在一些交易所购买 ETH，并直接将其提取到 Arbitrum，或者你可以使用 Arbitrum 跨链桥将 ETH 从主网钱包发送到 L2：[bridge.arbitrum.io](http://bridge.arbitrum.io)。由于 Arbitrum 上的燃气费用较低，你只需要一小笔资金即可。建议你设置一个较低的阈值（例如 0.01 ETH），以便你的交易得到批准。

## Finding the Subgraph Transfer Tool

You can find the L2 Transfer Tool when you're looking at your Subgraph's page on Subgraph Studio:

![transfer tool](/img/L2-transfer-tool1.png)

It is also available on Explorer if you're connected with the wallet that owns a Subgraph and on that Subgraph's page on Explorer:

![Transferring to L2](/img/transferToL2.png)

点击 "Transfer to L2" 按钮将打开转移工具，在那里你可以开始转移进程。

## 第 1 步：开始转移

Before starting the transfer, you must decide which address will own the Subgraph on L2 (see "Choosing your L2 wallet" above), and it is strongly recommend having some ETH for gas already bridged on Arbitrum (see "Preparing for the transfer: bridging some ETH" above).

Also please note transferring the Subgraph requires having a nonzero amount of signal on the Subgraph with the same account that owns the Subgraph; if you haven't signaled on the Subgraph you will have to add a bit of curation (adding a small amount like 1 GRT would suffice).

After opening the Transfer Tool, you will be able to input the L2 wallet address into the "Receiving wallet address" field - **make sure you've entered the correct address here**. Clicking on Transfer Subgraph will prompt you to execute the transaction on your wallet (note some ETH value is included to pay for L2 gas); this will initiate the transfer and deprecate your L1 Subgraph (see "Understanding what happens with signal, your L1 Subgraph and query URLs" above for more details on what goes on behind the scenes).

If you execute this step, **make sure you proceed until completing step 3 in less than 7 days, or the Subgraph and your signal GRT will be lost.** This is due to how L1-L2 messaging works on Arbitrum: messages that are sent through the bridge are "retry-able tickets" that must be executed within 7 days, and the initial execution might need a retry if there are spikes in the gas price on Arbitrum.

## Step 2: Waiting for the Subgraph to get to L2

After you start the transfer, the message that sends your L1 Subgraph to L2 must propagate through the Arbitrum bridge. This takes approximately 20 minutes (the bridge waits for the mainnet block containing the transaction to be "safe" from potential chain reorgs).

等待时间结束后，Arbitrum 将尝试自动在 L2 合约上执行转移。

![Wait screen](/img/screenshotOfWaitScreenL2.png)

## 第 3 步：确认转移

In most cases, this step will auto-execute as the L2 gas included in step 1 should be sufficient to execute the transaction that receives the Subgraph on the Arbitrum contracts. In some cases, however, it is possible that a spike in gas prices on Arbitrum causes this auto-execution to fail. In this case, the "ticket" that sends your Subgraph to L2 will be pending and require a retry within 7 days.

如果是这种情况，你将需要使用在 Arbitrum 上有一些 ETH 的 L2 钱包进行连接，将你的钱包网络切换到 Arbitrum，并点击“Confirm Transfer”以重试交易。

![Confirm the transfer to L2](/img/confirmTransferToL2.png)

## 第 4 步：在 L2 上完成转移

At this point, your Subgraph and GRT have been received on Arbitrum, but the Subgraph is not published yet. You will need to connect using the L2 wallet that you chose as the receiving wallet, switch your wallet network to Arbitrum, and click "Publish Subgraph."

![Publish the Subgraph](/img/publishSubgraphL2TransferTools.png)

![Wait for the Subgraph to be published](/img/waitForSubgraphToPublishL2TransferTools.png)

This will publish the Subgraph so that Indexers that are operating on Arbitrum can start serving it. It will also mint curation signal using the GRT that were transferred from L1.

## 第 5 步：更新查询 URL

Your Subgraph has been successfully transferred to Arbitrum! To query the Subgraph, the new URL will be :

`https://arbitrum-gateway.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/[l2-subgraph-id]`

Note that the Subgraph ID on Arbitrum will be a different than the one you had on mainnet, but you can always find it on Explorer or Studio. As mentioned above (see "Understanding what happens with signal, your L1 Subgraph and query URLs") the old L1 URL will be supported for a short while, but you should switch your queries to the new address as soon as the Subgraph has been synced on L2.

## 如何将你的策展转移到 Arbitrum（L2）

## Understanding what happens to curation on Subgraph transfers to L2

When the owner of a Subgraph transfers a Subgraph to Arbitrum, all of the Subgraph's signal is converted to GRT at the same time. This applies to "auto-migrated" signal, i.e. signal that is not specific to a Subgraph version or deployment but that follows the latest version of a Subgraph.

This conversion from signal to GRT is the same as what would happen if the Subgraph owner deprecated the Subgraph in L1. When the Subgraph is deprecated or transferred, all curation signal is "burned" simultaneously (using the curation bonding curve) and the resulting GRT is held by the GNS smart contract (that is the contract that handles Subgraph upgrades and auto-migrated signal). Each Curator on that Subgraph therefore has a claim to that GRT proportional to the amount of shares they had for the Subgraph.

A fraction of these GRT corresponding to the Subgraph owner is sent to L2 together with the Subgraph.

At this point, the curated GRT will not accrue any more query fees, so Curators can choose to withdraw their GRT or transfer it to the same Subgraph on L2, where it can be used to mint new curation signal. There is no rush to do this as the GRT can be help indefinitely and everybody gets an amount proportional to their shares, irrespective of when they do it.

## 选择你的 L2 钱包

如果决定将策展的GRT转移到L2，可以选择一个不同的钱包作为L2上的策展信号的所有者。

如果使用的是像 Metamask 这样的“普通”钱包（即外部拥有的账户或EOA，即不是智能合约钱包），则此操作是可选的，并建议保持与L1相同的策展人地址。

如果你使用的是智能合约钱包，如多签钱包（例如 Safe），则必须选择不同的L2钱包地址，因为这个账户很可能仅存在于主网，无法使用此钱包在 Arbitrum 上进行交易。如果希望继续使用智能合约钱包或多签钱包，请在 Arbitrum 上创建一个新的钱包，并使用其地址作为L2接收钱包地址。

**使用您自己控制的、可以在 Arbitrum 上进行交易的钱包地址非常重要，否则策展将丢失且无法恢复。**

## 发送策展到L2：步骤1

在开始转移之前，您必须决定哪个地址将在L2上拥有策展信号（参见上文的“选择您的L2钱包”），并建议您当需要在L2上重试消息执行时，提前转移一些用于手续费的 ETH到Arbitrum 上。您可以在某些交易所购买 ETH，并直接提款到 Arbitrum，或者您可以使用 Arbitrum 跨链桥将 ETH 从主网钱包发送到 L2： [bridge.arbitrum.io](http://bridge.arbitrum.io) - 由于 Arbitrum 上的燃料费用非常低，您可能只需要一小笔金额，例如 0.01 ETH 应该足够了。

If a Subgraph that you curate to has been transferred to L2, you will see a message on Explorer telling you that you're curating to a transferred Subgraph.

When looking at the Subgraph page, you can choose to withdraw or transfer the curation. Clicking on "Transfer Signal to Arbitrum" will open the transfer tool.

![Transfer signal](/img/transferSignalL2TransferTools.png)

打开转移工具后，如果您没有任何ETH，可能需要向您的钱包添加一些ETH。然后，您将能够在“Receiving wallet address”字段中输入L2钱包地址 - 请确保在此处输入正确的地址。点击转移信号将提示您在钱包上执行交易（注意，包含了一些ETH用于支付L2的燃气费）；这将启动转移过程。

如果执行了此步骤，请确保在不到7天的时间内继续完成第3步，否则您的信号GRT将丢失。这是由于在Arbitrum上的L1-L2消息传递的工作方式：通过跨链桥发送的消息是“可重试的票据”，必须在7天内执行。如果Arbitrum的燃气价格出现波动，初始执行可能需要重试。

## 发送策展到L2：步骤2

开始转移：

![Send signal to L2](/img/sendingCurationToL2Step2First.png)

在开始转移后，发送您的L1策展到L2的消息必须通过Arbitrum跨链桥传播。这大约需要20分钟（跨链桥等待包含交易的主网区块从潜在的链重组中“安全”）。

等待时间结束后，Arbitrum 将尝试自动在 L2 合约上执行转移。

![Sending curation signal to L2](/img/sendingCurationToL2Step2Second.png)

## 将策展转移到L2：步骤3

在大多数情况下，此步骤将自动执行，因为步骤1中包含的L2燃气应足以执行接收策展的交易。但是，在某些情况下，Arbitrum上燃气价格的激增可能导致此自动执行失败。在这种情况下，发送您的策展到L2的“票据”将处于待处理状态，并在7天内需要重试。

如果是这种情况，你将需要使用在 Arbitrum 上有一些 ETH 的 L2 钱包进行连接，将你的钱包网络切换到 Arbitrum，并点击“Confirm Transfer”以重试交易。

## 从L1上撤回您的策展

If you prefer not to send your GRT to L2, or you'd rather bridge the GRT manually, you can withdraw your curated GRT on L1. On the banner on the Subgraph page, choose "Withdraw Signal" and confirm the transaction; the GRT will be sent to your Curator address.
