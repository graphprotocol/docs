## Why did The Graph implement an L2 Solution?

By scaling The Graph on L2, network participants can now benefit from:

- 燃气费节省26倍以上

- 更快的交易处理速度

- 从以太坊继承的安全性

Scaling the protocol smart contracts onto L2 allows network participants to interact more frequently at a reduced cost in gas fees. For example, Indexers can open and close allocations more frequently to index a greater number of Subgraphs. Developers can deploy and update Subgraphs more easily, and Delegators can delegate GRT more frequently. Curators can add or remove signal to a larger number of Subgraphs–actions previously considered too cost-prohibitive to perform frequently due to gas.

去年，Graph社区在[GIP-0031](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0031-arbitrum-grt-bridge/3305) 讨论的结果之后，决定推进Arbitrum。

## 我需要做什么才能在L2上使用Graph？

The Graph’s billing system accepts GRT on Arbitrum, and users will need ETH on Arbitrum to pay their gas. While The Graph protocol started on Ethereum Mainnet, all activity, including the billing contracts, is now on Arbitrum One.

Consequently, to pay for queries, you need GRT on Arbitrum. Here are a few different ways to achieve this:

- If you already have GRT on Ethereum, you can bridge it to Arbitrum. You can do this via the GRT bridging option provided in Subgraph Studio or by using one of the following bridges:

  - [The Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
  - [TransferTo](https://transferto.xyz/swap)

- If you have other assets on Arbitrum, you can swap them for GRT through a swapping protocol like Uniswap.

- Alternatively, you can acquire GRT directly on Arbitrum through a decentralized exchange.

Once you have GRT on Arbitrum, you can add it to your billing balance.

## As a Subgraph developer, data consumer, Indexer, Curator, or Delegator, what do I need to do now?

Network participants must move to Arbitrum to continue participating in The Graph Network. Please refer to [L2 Transfer Tool Guide](/archived/arbitrum/l2-transfer-tools-guide/) for additional support.

All indexing rewards are now entirely on Arbitrum.

## Were there any risks associated with scaling the network to L2?

All smart contracts have been thoroughly [audited](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/main/packages/contracts/audits/OpenZeppelin/2022-07-graph-arbitrum-bridge-audit.pdf).

所有事项已经经过了彻底测试，并制定了应急计划，以确保安全和无缝过渡。详细信息可以在 [这里] (https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0037-the-graph-arbitrum-deployment-with-linear-rewards-minted-in-l2/3551#risks-and-security-considerations-20)找到。

## Are existing Subgraphs on Ethereum working?

All Subgraphs are now on Arbitrum. Please refer to [L2 Transfer Tool Guide](/archived/arbitrum/l2-transfer-tools-guide/) to ensure your Subgraphs operate seamlessly.

## Does GRT have a new smart contract deployed on Arbitrum?

是的，GRT在Arbitrum上有一个额外的[智能合约](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9623063377ad1b27544c965ccd7342f7ea7e88c7)。然而，以太坊主网上的 [GRT合约](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7)将继续保持运营。

## Arbitrum账单常见问题解答

## 我需要如何处理账单余额中的GRT？

什么都不用做！您的GRT已安全迁移到Arbitrum，并用于支付您阅读本文时的查询费用。

## 如何知道我的资金已安全转移到Arbitrum？

所有GRT的计费余额已成功迁移到Arbitrum。您可以在Arbitrum上查看计费合约 [here](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1B07D3344188908Fb6DEcEac381f3eE63C48477a)。

## 怎么知道Arbitrum 跨链桥是安全的？

为确保所有用户的安全性和安全性，该跨链桥经过了[严格的审计](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-the-graph-l2-bridge-contest)。

## 如果从以太坊主网钱包添加新的GRT，需要做什么？

您可以通过在[Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/)中进行一键体验，将GRT添加到您的Arbitrum计费余额中。您将能够通过一笔交易轻松将您的GRT桥接到Arbitrum并填写您的API密钥。
