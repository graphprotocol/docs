Learn how to initialize a Solana-based Substreams project within the Dev Container.

> Note: This guide excludes [Account Changes](/substreams/developing/solana/account-changes/).

## Options

If you prefer to begin locally within your terminal rather than through the Dev Container (VS Code required), refer to the [Substreams CLI installation guide](https://docs.substreams.dev/reference-material/substreams-cli/installing-the-cli).

## Step 1: Initialize Your Solana Substreams Project

1. Open the [Dev Container](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-starter) and follow the on-screen steps to initialize your project.

2. Running `substreams init` will give you the option to choose between two Solana project options. Select the best option for your project:
   - **sol-minimal**: This creates a simple Substreams that extracts raw Solana block data and generates corresponding Rust code. This path will start you with the full raw block, and you can navigate to the `substreams.yaml` (the manifest) to modify the input.
   - **sol-transactions**: This creates a Substreams that filters Solana transactions based on one or more Program IDs and/or Account IDs, using the cached [Solana Foundational Module](https://substreams.dev/streamingfast/solana-common/v0.3.0).
   - **sol-anchor-beta**: This creates a Substreams that decodes instructions and events with an Anchor IDL. If an IDL isn’t available (reference [Anchor CLI](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/cli)), then you’ll need to provide it yourself.

The modules within Solana Common do not include voting transactions. To gain a 75% reduction in data processing size and costs, delay your stream by over 1000 blocks from the head. This can be done using the [`sleep`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.sleep.html) function in Rust.

To access voting transactions, use the full Solana block, `sf.solana.type.v1.Block`, as input.

## Step 2: Visualize the Data

1. Run `substreams auth` to create your [account](https://thegraph.market/) and generate an authentication token (JWT), then pass this token back as input.

2. Now you can freely use the `substreams gui` to visualize and iterate on your extracted data.

## Step 2.5: (Optionally) Transform the Data

Within the generated directories, modify your Substreams modules to include additional filters, aggregations, and transformations, then update the manifest accordingly.

## Step 3: Load the Data

To make your Substreams queryable (as opposed to [direct streaming](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/stream)), you can automatically generate a [Substreams-powered Subgraph](/sps/introduction/) or SQL-DB sink.

### Subgraf

1. Run `substreams codegen subgraph` to initialize the sink, producing the necessary files and function definitions.
2. Create your [Subgraph mappings](/sps/triggers/) within the `mappings.ts` and associated entities within the `schema.graphql`.
3. Build and deploy locally or to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio-pricing/) by running `deploy-studio`.

### SQL

1. Run `substreams codegen sql` and choose from either ClickHouse or Postgres to initialize the sink, producing the necessary files.
2. Run `substreams build` build the [Substream SQL](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/sql-sink) sink.
3. Run `substreams-sink-sql` to sink the data into your selected SQL DB.

> Note: Run `help` to better navigate the development environment and check the health of containers.
