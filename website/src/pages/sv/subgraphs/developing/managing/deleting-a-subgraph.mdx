title: Deleting a Subgraph
---

Delete your Subgraph using [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

> Deleting your Subgraph will remove all published versions from The Graph Network, but it will remain visible on Graph Explorer and Subgraph Studio for users who have signaled on it.

## Step-by-Step

1. Visit the Subgraph's page on [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

2. Click on the three-dots to the right of the "publish" button.

3. Click on the option to "delete this Subgraph":

4. Depending on the Subgraph's status, you will be prompted with various options.

   - If the Subgraph is not published, simply click “delete” and confirm.
   - If the Subgraph is published, you will need to confirm on your wallet before the Subgraph can be deleted from Studio. If a Subgraph is published to multiple networks, such as testnet and mainnet, additional steps may be required.

> If the owner of the Subgraph has signal on it, the signaled GRT will be returned to the owner.

### Important Reminders

- Once you delete a Subgraph, it will **not** appear on Graph Explorer's homepage. However, users who have signaled on it will still be able to view it on their profile pages and remove their signal.
- Curators will not be able to signal on the Subgraph anymore.
- Curators that already signaled on the Subgraph can withdraw their signal at an average share price.
- Deleted Subgraphs will show an error message.
