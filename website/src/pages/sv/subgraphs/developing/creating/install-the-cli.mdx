title: Installera Graph CLI
---

> In order to use your Subgraph on The Graph's decentralized network, you will need to [create an API key](/resources/subgraph-studio-faq/#2-how-do-i-create-an-api-key) in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/). It is recommended that you add signal to your Subgraph with at least 3,000 GRT to attract 2-3 Indexers. To learn more about signaling, check out [curating](/resources/roles/curating/).

## Översikt

The [Graph CLI](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling/tree/main/packages/cli) is a command-line interface that facilitates developers' commands for The Graph. It processes a [Subgraph manifest](/subgraphs/developing/creating/subgraph-manifest/) and compiles the [mappings](/subgraphs/developing/creating/assemblyscript-mappings/) to create the files you will need to deploy the Subgraph to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and the network.

## Komma igång

### Installera Graph CLI

The Graph CLI is written in TypeScript, and you must have `node` and either `npm` or `yarn` installed to use it. Check for the [most recent](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling/releases?q=%40graphprotocol%2Fgraph-cli&expanded=true) CLI version.

Kör ett av följande kommandon på din lokala dator:

#### Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli@latest
```

#### Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

```bash
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

The `graph init` command can be used to set up a new Subgraph project, either from an existing contract or from an example Subgraph. If you already have a smart contract deployed to your preferred network, you can bootstrap a new Subgraph from that contract to get started.

## Skapa en Subgraf

### Från ett befintligt avtal

The following command creates a Subgraph that indexes all events of an existing contract:

```sh
graph init \
  --product subgraph-studio
  --from-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  [--network <ETHEREUM_NETWORK>] \
  [--abi <FILE>] \
  <SUBGRAPH_SLUG> [<DIRECTORY>]
```

- The command tries to retrieve the contract ABI from Etherscan.

  - The Graph CLI relies on a public RPC endpoint. While occasional failures are expected, retries typically resolve this issue. If failures persist, consider using a local ABI.

- If any of the optional arguments are missing, it guides you through an interactive form.

- The `<SUBGRAPH_SLUG>` is the ID of your Subgraph in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/). It can be found on your Subgraph details page.

### Från ett exempel på en undergraf

The following command initializes a new project from an example Subgraph:

```sh
graph init <SUBGRAPH_SLUG> --from-example=example-subgraph
```

- The [example Subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph) is based on the Gravity contract by Dani Grant, which manages user avatars and emits `NewGravatar` or `UpdateGravatar` events whenever avatars are created or updated.

- The Subgraph handles these events by writing `Gravatar` entities to the Graph Node store and ensuring these are updated according to the events.

### Add New `dataSources` to an Existing Subgraph

`dataSources` are key components of Subgraphs. They define the sources of data that the Subgraph indexes and processes. A `dataSource` specifies which smart contract to listen to, which events to process, and how to handle them.

Recent versions of the Graph CLI supports adding new `dataSources` to an existing Subgraph through the `graph add` command:

```sh
graph add <address> [<subgraph-manifest default: "./subgraph.yaml">]

Options:

      --abi <path>              Path to the contract ABI (default: download from Etherscan)
      --contract-name           Name of the contract (default: Contract)
      --merge-entities          Whether to merge entities with the same name (default: false)
      --network-file <path>     Networks config file path (default: "./networks.json")
```

#### Specifics

The `graph add` command will fetch the ABI from Etherscan (unless an ABI path is specified with the `--abi` option) and creates a new `dataSource`, similar to how the `graph init` command creates a `dataSource` `--from-contract`, updating the schema and mappings accordingly. This allows you to index implementation contracts from their proxy contracts.

- The `--merge-entities` option identifies how the developer would like to handle `entity` and `event` name conflicts:

  - If `true`: the new `dataSource` should use existing `eventHandlers` & `entities`.

  - If `false`: a new `entity` & `event` handler should be created with `${dataSourceName}{EventName}`.

- The contract `address` will be written to the `networks.json` for the relevant network.

> Note: When using the interactive CLI, after successfully running `graph init`, you'll be prompted to add a new `dataSource`.

### Getting The ABIs

ABI-filerna måste matcha ditt/dina kontrakt. Det finns några olika sätt att få ABI-filer:

- Om du bygger ditt eget projekt har du förmodligen tillgång till dina senaste ABIs.
- If you are building a Subgraph for a public project, you can download that project to your computer and get the ABI by using [`npx hardhat compile`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/compile-contracts#compiling-your-contracts) or using `solc` to compile.
- You can also find the ABI on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), but this isn't always reliable, as the ABI that is uploaded there may be out of date. Make sure you have the right ABI, otherwise running your Subgraph will fail.
