title: GraphTally Guide
---

Learn about The Graph’s new payment system, **GraphTally** [(previously Timeline Aggregation Protocol)](https://docs.rs/tap_core/latest/tap_core/index.html). This system provides fast, efficient microtransactions with minimized trust.

## Översikt

GraphTally is a drop-in replacement to the Scalar payment system currently in place. It provides the following key features:

- Efficiently handles micropayments.
- Adds a layer of consolidations to onchain transactions and costs.
- Allows Indexers control of receipts and payments, guaranteeing payment for queries.
- It enables decentralized, trustless gateways and improves `indexer-service` performance for multiple senders.

### Specifics

GraphTally allows a sender to make multiple payments to a receiver, **Receipts**, which aggregates these payments into a single payment, a **Receipt Aggregate Voucher**, also known as a **RAV**. This aggregated payment can then be verified on the blockchain, reducing the number of transactions and simplifying the payment process.

For each query, the gateway will send you a `signed receipt` that is stored on your database. Then, these queries will be aggregated by a `tap-agent` through a request. Afterwards, you’ll receive a RAV. You can update a RAV by sending it with newer receipts and this will generate a new RAV with an increased value.

### RAV Details

- It’s money that is waiting to be sent to the blockchain.

- It will continue to send requests to aggregate and ensure that the total value of non-aggregated receipts does not exceed the `amount willing to lose`.

- Each RAV can be redeemed once in the contracts, which is why they are sent after the allocation is closed.

### Redeeming RAV

As long as you run `tap-agent` and `indexer-agent`, everything will be executed automatically. The following provides a detailed breakdown of the process:

1. An Indexer closes allocation.

2. `<recently-closed-allocation-buffer> period, tap-agent` takes all pending receipts for that specific allocation and requests an aggregation into a RAV, marking it as `last`.

3. `indexer-agent` takes all the last RAVS and sends redeem requests to the blockchain, which will update the value of `redeem_at`.

4. During the `<finality-time>` period, `indexer-agent` monitors if the blockchain has any reorganizations that revert the transaction.

   - If it was reverted, the RAV is resent to the blockchain. If it was not reverted, it gets marked as `final`.

### Prerequisites

In addition to the typical requirements to run an indexer, you’ll need a `tap-escrow-subgraph` endpoint to query updates. You can use The Graph Network to query or host yourself on your `graph-node`.

- [Graph TAP Arbitrum Sepolia Subgraph (for The Graph testnet)](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/7ubx365MiqBH5iUz6XWXWT8PTof5BVAyEzdb8m17RvbD)
- [Graph TAP Arbitrum One Subgraph (for The Graph mainnet)](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/4sukbNVTzGELnhdnpyPqsf1QqtzNHEYKKmJkgaT8z6M1)

> Note: `indexer-agent` does not currently handle the indexing of this Subgraph like it does for the network Subgraph deployment. As a result, you have to index it manually.

## Migration Guide

### Software versions

The required software version can be found [here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/networks/arbitrum-one.md#latest-releases).

### Steps

1. **Indexer Agent**

   - Follow the [same process](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/pkgs/container/indexer-agent#graph-protocol-indexer-components).
   - Give the new argument `--tap-subgraph-endpoint` to activate the new GraphTally codepaths and enable redeeming of RAVs.

2. **Indexer Service**

   - Fully replace your current configuration with the [new Indexer Service rs](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs). It's recommend that you use the [container image](https://github.com/orgs/graphprotocol/packages?repo_name=indexer-rs).
   - Like the older version, you can scale Indexer Service horizontally easily. It is still stateless.

3. **TAP Agent**

   - Run _one_ single instance of [TAP Agent](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs) at all times. It's recommend that you use the [container image](https://github.com/orgs/graphprotocol/packages?repo_name=indexer-rs).

4. **Configure Indexer Service and TAP Agent**

   Configuration is a TOML file shared between `indexer-service` and `tap-agent`, supplied with the argument `--config /path/to/config.toml`.

   Check out the full [configuration](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs/blob/main/config/maximal-config-example.toml) and the [default values](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs/blob/main/config/default_values.toml)

For minimal configuration, use the following template:

```bash
# You will have to change *all* the values below to match your setup.
#
# Some of the config below are global graph network values, which you can find here:
# <https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/tree/main/docs/networks>
#
# Pro tip: if you need to load some values from the environment into this config, you
# can overwrite with environment variables. For example, the following can be replaced
# by [PREFIX]_DATABASE_POSTGRESURL, where PREFIX can be `INDEXER_SERVICE` or `TAP_AGENT`:
#
# [database]
# postgres_url = "postgresql://indexer:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/indexer_components_0"

[indexer]
indexer_address = "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
operator_mnemonic = "celery smart tip orange scare van steel radio dragon joy alarm crane"

[database]
# The URL of the Postgres database used for the indexer components. The same database
# that is used by the `indexer-agent`. It is expected that `indexer-agent` will create
# the necessary tables.
postgres_url = "postgres://postgres@postgres:5432/postgres"

[graph_node]
# URL to your graph-node's query endpoint
query_url = "<http://graph-node:8000>"
# URL to your graph-node's status endpoint
status_url = "<http://graph-node:8000/graphql>"

[subgraphs.network]
# Query URL for the Graph Network Subgraph.
query_url = "<http://example.com/network-subgraph>"
# Optional, deployment to look for in the local `graph-node`, if locally indexed.
# Locally indexing the Subgraph is recommended.
# NOTE: Use `query_url` or `deployment_id` only
deployment_id = "Qmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

[subgraphs.escrow]
# Query URL for the Escrow Subgraph.
query_url = "<http://example.com/network-subgraph>"
# Optional, deployment to look for in the local `graph-node`, if locally indexed.
# Locally indexing the Subgraph is recommended.
# NOTE: Use `query_url` or `deployment_id` only
deployment_id = "Qmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

[blockchain]
# The chain ID of the network that the graph network is running on
chain_id = 1337
# Contract address of TAP's receipt aggregate voucher (RAV) verifier.
receipts_verifier_address = "0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222"

########################################
# Specific configurations to tap-agent #
########################################
[tap]
# This is the amount of fees you are willing to risk at any given time. For ex.
# if the sender stops supplying RAVs for long enough and the fees exceed this
# amount, the indexer-service will stop accepting queries from the sender
# until the fees are aggregated.
# NOTE: Use strings for decimal values to prevent rounding errors
# e.g:
# max_amount_willing_to_lose_grt = "0.1"
max_amount_willing_to_lose_grt = 20

[tap.sender_aggregator_endpoints]
# Key-Value of all senders and their aggregator endpoints
# This one below is for the E&N testnet gateway for example.
0xDDE4cfFd3D9052A9cb618fC05a1Cd02be1f2F467 = "https://tap-aggregator.network.thegraph.com"
```

Noteringar:

- Values for `tap.sender_aggregator_endpoints` can be found in the [gateway section](/indexing/tap/#gateway).
- Values for `blockchain.receipts_verifier_address` must be used accordingly to the [Blockchain addresses section](/indexing/tap/#contracts) using the appropriate chain id.

**Log Level**

- You can set the log level by using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.
- It’s recommended that you set it to `RUST_LOG=indexer_tap_agent=debug,info`.
