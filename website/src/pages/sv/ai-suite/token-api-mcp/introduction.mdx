Token API MCP server is an open-source implementation of [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

It makes on-chain token data, including metadata, balances, transfers, and holder statistics, accessible through a set of MCP tools. Any compatible client can use these tools to fetch and analyze token information through a standardized interface.

The server itself does not host any language model. It simply converts MCP calls into data look-ups and returns structured results, letting the client's own LLM incorporate the results.

Think of it as a USB-C hub: it standardizes the plug-and-play connection between AI agents and The Graph's Token API data.

## What You Can Do

- Retrieve token metadata including name, symbol, decimals, total supply, and contract address
- Get token balances for any wallet address holding a supported ERC-20 token
- Fetch token transfer activity including sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp
- Identify top holders and analyze token distribution
- Ask natural language questions about token data without writing smart contract calls
- Access historical transfer data to analyze token movement over time

The Token MCP server provides [Claude](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/claude/), [Cline](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/cline/), and [Cursor](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/cursor/) with direct, conversational access to onchain token data.
