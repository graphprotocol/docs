title: Problemi comuni di AssemblyScript
---

There are certain [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) issues that are common to run into during Subgraph development. They range in debug difficulty, however, being aware of them may help. The following is a non-exhaustive list of these issues:

- `Private` class variables are not enforced in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/status.html#language-features). There is no way to protect class variables from being directly changed from the class object.
- L'ambito non è ereditato nelle [closure functions](https://www.assemblyscript.org/status.html#on-closures), cioè le variabili dichiarate al di fuori delle closure functions non possono essere utilizzate.
