sidebarTitle: Using Subgraph Composition with Sushiswap v3 on Base
---

Leverage Subgraph composition to speed up development time. Create a base Subgraph with essential data, then build additional Subgraphs on top of it.

> Important Reminders:
>
> - Subgraph composition is built into the CLI, and you can deploy with [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).
> - You can use existing Subgraphs, but they must be redeployed with `specVersion` 1.3.0, which doesn't require you to write new code.
> - You may want to restructure your Subgraph to split out the logic as you move to a composable Subgraph world.

## Introduzione

Composable Subgraphs enable you to combine multiple Subgraphs' data sources into a new Subgraph, facilitating faster and more flexible Subgraph development. Subgraph composition empowers you to create and maintain smaller, focused subgraphs that collectively form a larger, interconnected dataset.

### Benefits of Composition

Subgraph composition is a powerful feature for scaling, allowing you to:

- Reuse, mix, and combine existing data
- Streamline development and queries
- Use multiple data sources (up to five source Subgraphs)
- Speed up your Subgraph's syncing speed
- Handle errors and optimize the resync

## Architecture Overview

The setup for this example involves two Subgraphs:

1. **Source Subgraph**: Tracks event data as entities.
2. **Dependent Subgraph**: Uses the source Subgraph as a data source.

You can find these in the `source` and `dependent` directories.

- The **source Subgraph** is a basic event-tracking Subgraph that records events emitted by relevant contracts.
- The **dependent Subgraph** references the source Subgraph as a data source, using the entities from the source as triggers.

While the source Subgraph is a standard Subgraph, the dependent Subgraph uses the Subgraph composition feature.

### Source Subgraph

The source Subgraph tracks events from the Sushiswap v3 Subgraph on the Base chain. This Subgraph's configuration file is `source/subgraph.yaml`.

> The `source/subgraph.yaml` employs the advanced Subgraph feature, [declarative `eth_calls`](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/developing/creating/advanced/#declared-eth_call). To review the code for this `source/subgraph.yaml`, check out the [source Subgraph example repo](https://github.com/incrypto32/subgraph-composition-sample-subgraph/blob/a5f13cb4b961f92d5c5631dca589c54feb1c0a19/source/subgraph.yaml).

### Dependent Subgraph

The dependent Subgraph is in the `dependent/subgraph.yaml` file, which specifies the source Subgraph as a data source. This Subgraph uses entities from the source to trigger specific actions based on changes to those entities.

> To review the code for this `dependent/subgraph.yaml`, check out the [dependent Subgraph example repo](https://github.com/incrypto32/subgraph-composition-sample-subgraph/blob/main/dependant/subgraph.yaml).

## Iniziare

The following is a guide that illustrates how to use one Subgraph as a data source for another. This example uses:

- Sushiswap v3 Subgraph on Base chain
- Two Subgraphs (but you can use up to **5 source** Subgraphs in your own development).

### Step 1. Set Up Your Source Subgraph

To set the source Subgraph as a data source in the dependent Subgraph, include the following in `subgraph.yaml`:

```yaml
specVersion: 1.3.0
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: subgraph
    name: Factory
    network: base
    source:
      address: 'QmdXu8byAFCGSDWsB5gMQjWr6GUvEVB7S1hemfxNuomerz'
      startBlock: 82522
```

Here, `source.address` refers to the Deployment ID of the source Subgraph, and `startBlock` specifies the block from which indexing should begin.

### Step 2. Define Handlers in Dependent Subgraph

Below is an example of defining handlers in the dependent Subgraph:

```typescript
export function handleInitialize(trigger: EntityTrigger<Initialize>): void {
  if (trigger.operation === EntityOp.Create) {
    let entity = trigger.data
    let poolAddressParam = Address.fromBytes(entity.poolAddress)

    // Update pool sqrt price and tick
    let pool = Pool.load(poolAddressParam.toHexString()) as Pool
    pool.sqrtPrice = entity.sqrtPriceX96
    pool.tick = BigInt.fromI32(entity.tick)
    pool.save()

    // Update token prices
    let token0 = Token.load(pool.token0) as Token
    let token1 = Token.load(pool.token1) as Token

    // Update ETH price in USD
    let bundle = Bundle.load('1') as Bundle
    bundle.ethPriceUSD = getEthPriceInUSD()
    bundle.save()

    updatePoolDayData(entity)
    updatePoolHourData(entity)

    // Update derived ETH price for tokens
    token0.derivedETH = findEthPerToken(token0)
    token1.derivedETH = findEthPerToken(token1)
    token0.save()
    token1.save()
  }
}
```

In this example, the `handleInitialize` function is triggered when a new `Initialize` entity is created in the source Subgraph, passed as `EntityTrigger<Initialize>`. The handler updates the pool and token entities based on data from the new `Initialize` entity.

`EntityTrigger` has three fields:

1. `operation`: Specifies the operation type, which can be `Create`, `Modify`, or `Remove`.
2. `type`: Indicates the entity type.
3. `data`: Contains the entity data.

Developers can then determine specific actions for the entity data based on the operation type.

## Key Takeaways

- Use this powerful tool to quickly scale your Subgraph development and reuse existing data.
- The setup includes creating a base source Subgraph and referencing it in a dependent Subgraph.
- You define handlers in the dependent Subgraph to perform actions based on changes in the source Subgraph's entities.

This approach unlocks composability and scalability, simplifying both development and maintenance efficiency.
