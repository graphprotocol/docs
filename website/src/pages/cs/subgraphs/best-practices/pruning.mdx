## TLDR

[Pruning](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#prune) removes archival entities from the Subgraph’s database up to a given block, and removing unused entities from a Subgraph’s database will improve a Subgraph’s query performance, often dramatically. Using `indexerHints` is an easy way to prune a Subgraph.

## Jak prořezat podgraf pomocí `indexerHints`

Přidejte do manifestu sekci `indexerHints`.

`indexerHints` má tři možnosti `prune`:

- `prune: auto`: Retains the minimum necessary history as set by the Indexer, optimizing query performance. This is the generally recommended setting and is the default for all Subgraphs created by `graph-cli` >= 0.66.0.
- `prune: <Number of blocks to retain>`: Nastaví vlastní omezení počtu historických bloků, které se mají zachovat.
- `prune: never`: No pruning of historical data; retains the entire history and is the default if there is no `indexerHints` section. `prune: never` should be selected if [Time Travel Queries](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#time-travel-queries) are desired.

We can add `indexerHints` to our Subgraphs by updating our `subgraph.yaml`:

```yaml
specVersion: 1.3.0
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
indexerHints:
  prune: auto
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: Contract
    network: mainnet
```

## Důležité úvahy

- If [Time Travel Queries](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#time-travel-queries) are desired as well as pruning, pruning must be performed accurately to retain Time Travel Query functionality. Due to this, it is generally not recommended to use `indexerHints: prune: auto` with Time Travel Queries. Instead, prune using `indexerHints: prune: <Number of blocks to retain>` to accurately prune to a block height that preserves the historical data required by Time Travel Queries, or use `prune: never` to maintain all data.

- It is not possible to [graft](/subgraphs/cookbook/grafting/) at a block height that has been pruned. If grafting is routinely performed and pruning is desired, it is recommended to use `indexerHints: prune: <Number of blocks to retain>` that will accurately retain a set number of blocks (e.g., enough for six months).

## Závěr

Pruning using `indexerHints` is a best practice for Subgraph development, offering significant query performance improvements.
