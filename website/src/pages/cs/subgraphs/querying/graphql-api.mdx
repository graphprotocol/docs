Learn about the GraphQL Query API used in The Graph.

## What is GraphQL?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. The Graph uses GraphQL to query Subgraphs.

To understand the larger role that GraphQL plays, review [developing](/subgraphs/developing/introduction/) and [creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

## Queries with GraphQL

In your Subgraph schema you define types called `Entities`. For each `Entity` type, `entity` and `entities` fields will be generated on the top-level `Query` type.

> Note: `query` does not need to be included at the top of the `graphql` query when using The Graph.

### Příklady

Query for a single `Token` entity defined in your schema:

```graphql
{
  token(id: "1") {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

> Note: When querying for a single entity, the `id` field is required, and it must be written as a string.

Query all `Token` entities:

```graphql
{
  tokens {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

### Třídění

When querying a collection, you may:

- Use the `orderBy` parameter to sort by a specific attribute.
- Use the `orderDirection` to specify the sort direction, `asc` for ascending or `desc` for descending.

#### Příklad

```graphql
{
  tokens(orderBy: price, orderDirection: asc) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

#### Příklad vnořeného třídění entit

As of Graph Node [`v0.30.0`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases/tag/v0.30.0) entities can be sorted on the basis of nested entities.

The following example shows tokens sorted by the name of their owner:

```graphql
{
  tokens(orderBy: owner__name, orderDirection: asc) {
    id
    owner {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

> Currently, you can sort by one-level deep `String` or `ID` types on `@entity` and `@derivedFrom` fields. Unfortunately, [sorting by interfaces on one level-deep entities](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/pull/4058), sorting by fields which are arrays and nested entities is not yet supported.

### Stránkování

When querying a collection, it's best to:

- Use the `first` parameter to paginate from the beginning of the collection.
  - The default sort order is by `ID` in ascending alphanumeric order, **not** by creation time.
- Use the `skip` parameter to skip entities and paginate. For instance, `first:100` shows the first 100 entities and `first:100, skip:100` shows the next 100 entities.
- Avoid using `skip` values in queries because they generally perform poorly. To retrieve a large number of items, it's best to page through entities based on an attribute as shown in the previous example above.

#### Example using `first`

Dotaz na prvních 10 tokenů:

```graphql
{
  tokens(first: 10) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

To query for groups of entities in the middle of a collection, the `skip` parameter may be used in conjunction with the `first` parameter to skip a specified number of entities starting at the beginning of the collection.

#### Example using `first` and `skip`

Query 10 `Token` entities, offset by 10 places from the beginning of the collection:

```graphql
{
  tokens(first: 10, skip: 10) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

#### Example using `first` and `id_ge`

If a client needs to retrieve a large number of entities, it's more performant to base queries on an attribute and filter by that attribute. For example, a client could retrieve a large number of tokens using this query:

```graphql
query manyTokens($lastID: String) {
  tokens(first: 1000, where: { id_gt: $lastID }) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

The first time, it would send the query with `lastID = ""`, and for subsequent requests it would set `lastID` to the `id` attribute of the last entity in the previous request. This approach will perform significantly better than using increasing `skip` values.

### Filtrování

- You can use the `where` parameter in your queries to filter for different properties.
- You can filter on multiple values within the `where` parameter.

#### Example using `where`

Query challenges with `failed` outcome:

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { outcome: "failed" }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

You can use suffixes like `_gt`, `_lte` for value comparison:

#### Příklad filtrování rozsahu

```graphql
{
  applications(where: { deposit_gt: "10000000000" }) {
    id
    whitelisted
    deposit
  }
}
```

#### Příklad pro filtrování bloků

You can also filter entities that were updated in or after a specified block with `_change_block(number_gte: Int)`.

This can be useful if you are looking to fetch only entities which have changed, for example since the last time you polled. Or alternatively it can be useful to investigate or debug how entities are changing in your Subgraph (if combined with a block filter, you can isolate only entities that changed in a specific block).

```graphql
{
  applications(where: { _change_block: { number_gte: 100 } }) {
    id
    whitelisted
    deposit
  }
}
```

#### Příklad vnořeného filtrování entit

Filtering on the basis of nested entities is possible in the fields with the `_` suffix.

To může být užitečné, pokud chcete načíst pouze entity, jejichž entity podřízené úrovně splňují zadané podmínky.

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { application_: { id: 1 } }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

#### Logické operátory

As of Graph Node [`v0.30.0`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases/tag/v0.30.0) you can group multiple parameters in the same `where` argument using the `and` or the `or` operators to filter results based on more than one criteria.

##### `AND` Operator

The following example filters for challenges with `outcome` `succeeded` and `number` greater than or equal to `100`.

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { and: [{ number_gte: 100 }, { outcome: "succeeded" }] }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

> **Syntactic sugar:** You can simplify the above query by removing the `and` operator by passing a sub-expression separated by commas.
>
> ```graphql
> {
>   challenges(where: { number_gte: 100, outcome: "succeeded" }) {
>     challenger
>     outcome
>     application {
>       id
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

##### `OR` Operator

The following example filters for challenges with `outcome` `succeeded` or `number` greater than or equal to `100`.

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { or: [{ number_gte: 100 }, { outcome: "succeeded" }] }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: When constructing queries, it is important to consider the performance impact of using the `or` operator. While `or` can be a useful tool for broadening search results, it can also have significant costs. One of the main issues with `or` is that it can cause queries to slow down. This is because `or` requires the database to scan through multiple indexes, which can be a time-consuming process. To avoid these issues, it is recommended that developers use and operators instead of or whenever possible. This allows for more precise filtering and can lead to faster, more accurate queries.

> Please note that some suffixes are only supported for specific types. For example, `Boolean` only supports `_not`, `_in`, and `_not_in`, but `_` is available only for object and interface types.

In addition, the following global filters are available as part of `where` argument:

```graphql
_change_block(number_gte: Int)
```

### Dotazy na cestování čase

You can query the state of your entities not just for the latest block, which is the default, but also for an arbitrary block in the past. The block at which a query should happen can be specified either by its block number or its block hash by including a `block` argument in the toplevel fields of queries.

The result of such a query will not change over time, i.e., querying at a certain past block will return the same result no matter when it is executed, with the exception that if you query at a block very close to the head of the chain, the result might change if that block turns out to **not** be on the main chain and the chain gets reorganized. Once a block can be considered final, the result of the query will not change.

> Note: The current implementation is still subject to certain limitations that might violate these guarantees. The implementation can not always tell that a given block hash is not on the main chain at all, or if a query result by a block hash for a block that is not yet considered final could be influenced by a block reorganization running concurrently with the query. They do not affect the results of queries by block hash when the block is final and known to be on the main chain. [This issue](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/issues/1405) explains what these limitations are in detail.

#### Příklad

```graphql
{
  challenges(block: { number: 8000000 }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return `Challenge` entities, and their associated `Application` entities, as they existed directly after processing block number 8,000,000.

#### Příklad

```graphql
{
  challenges(block: { hash: "0x5a0b54d5dc17e0aadc383d2db43b0a0d3e029c4c" }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return `Challenge` entities, and their associated `Application` entities, as they existed directly after processing the block with the given hash.

### Fulltextové Vyhledávání dotazy

Fulltext search query fields provide an expressive text search API that can be added to the Subgraph schema and customized. Refer to [Defining Fulltext Search Fields](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#defining-fulltext-search-fields) to add fulltext search to your Subgraph.

Fulltext search queries have one required field, `text`, for supplying search terms. Several special fulltext operators are available to be used in this `text` search field.

Operátory fulltextového vyhledávání:

| Symbol | Operátor | Popis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&` | `And` | Pro kombinaci více vyhledávacích výrazů do filtru pro entity, které obsahují všechny zadané výrazy |
| &#x7c; | `Or` | Dotazy s více hledanými výrazy oddělenými operátorem nebo vrátí všechny entity, které odpovídají některému z uvedených výrazů |
| `<->` | `Follow by` | Zadejte vzdálenost mezi dvěma slovy. |
| `:*` | `Prefix` | Pomocí předponového výrazu vyhledejte slova, jejichž předpona se shoduje (vyžadovány 2 znaky) |

#### Příklady

Using the `or` operator, this query will filter to blog entities with variations of either "anarchism" or "crumpet" in their fulltext fields.

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "anarchism | crumpets") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

The `follow by` operator specifies a words a specific distance apart in the fulltext documents. The following query will return all blogs with variations of "decentralize" followed by "philosophy"

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "decentralized <-> philosophy") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

Kombinací fulltextových operátorů můžete vytvářet složitější filtry. S operátorem pretextového vyhledávání v kombinaci s operátorem follow by bude tento příklad dotazu odpovídat všem entitá blog se slovy začínajícími na "lou" a následovanými slovem "music".

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "lou:* <-> music") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

### Validace

Graph Node implements [specification-based](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Validation) validation of the GraphQL queries it receives using [graphql-tools-rs](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-tools-rs#validation-rules), which is based on the [graphql-js reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/main/src/validation). Queries which fail a validation rule do so with a standard error - visit the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Validation) to learn more.

## Schema

The schema of your dataSources, i.e. the entity types, values, and relationships that are available to query, are defined through the [GraphQL Interface Definition Language (IDL)](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec-Type-System).

GraphQL schemas generally define root types for `queries`, `subscriptions` and `mutations`. The Graph only supports `queries`. The root `Query` type for your Subgraph is automatically generated from the GraphQL schema that's included in your [Subgraph manifest](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#components-of-a-subgraph).

> Note: Our API does not expose mutations because developers are expected to issue transactions directly against the underlying blockchain from their applications.

### Entities

All GraphQL types with `@entity` directives in your schema will be treated as entities and must have an `ID` field.

> **Note:** Currently, all types in your schema must have an `@entity` directive. In the future, we will treat types without an `@entity` directive as value objects, but this is not yet supported.

### Metadata podgrafů

All Subgraphs have an auto-generated `_Meta_` object, which provides access to Subgraph metadata. This can be queried as follows:

```graphQL
{
  _meta(block: { number: 123987 }) {
    block {
      number
      hash
      timestamp
    }
    deployment
    hasIndexingErrors
  }
}
```

If a block is provided, the metadata is as of that block, if not the latest indexed block is used. If provided, the block must be after the Subgraph's start block, and less than or equal to the most recently indexed block.

`deployment` is a unique ID, corresponding to the IPFS CID of the `subgraph.yaml` file.

`block` provides information about the latest block (taking into account any block constraints passed to `_meta`):

- hash: hash bloku
- číslo: číslo bloku
- timestamp: the timestamp of the block, if available (this is currently only available for Subgraphs indexing EVM networks)

`hasIndexingErrors` is a boolean identifying whether the Subgraph encountered indexing errors at some past block
