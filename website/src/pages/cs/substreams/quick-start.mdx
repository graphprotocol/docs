Discover how to utilize ready-to-use substream packages or develop your own.

## Přehled

Integrating Substreams can be quick and easy. They are permissionless, and you can [obtain a key here](https://thegraph.market/) without providing personal information to start streaming on-chain data.

## Start Building

### Use Substreams Packages

There are many ready-to-use Substreams packages available. You can explore these packages by visiting the [Substreams Registry](https://substreams.dev) and [sinking them](/substreams/developing/sinks/). The registry lets you search for and find any package that meets your needs.

Once you find a package that fits your needs, you can choose how you want to consume the data:

- **[Subgraph](/sps/introduction/)**: Configure an API to meet your data needs and host it on The Graph Network.
- **[SQL Database](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/sql-sink)**: Send the data to a database.
- **[Direct Streaming](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/stream)**: Stream data directly to your application.
- **[PubSub](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/pubsub)**: Send data to a PubSub topic.

### Develop Your Own

If you can't find a Substreams package that meets your specific needs, you can develop your own. Substreams are built with Rust, so you'll write functions that extract and filter the data you need from the blockchain. To get started, check out the following tutorials:

- [EVM](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/evm)
- [Solana](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/on-solana)
- [Starknet](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/starknet)
- [Injective](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/on-cosmos/injective)
- [MANTRA](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/on-cosmos/mantra)
- [Stellar](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/stellar)

To build and optimize your Substreams from zero, use the minimal path within the [Dev Container](/substreams/developing/dev-container/).

> Note: Substreams guarantees that you'll [never miss data](https://docs.substreams.dev/reference-material/reliability-guarantees) with a simple reconnection policy.
