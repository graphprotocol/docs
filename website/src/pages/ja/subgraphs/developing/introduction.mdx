To start coding right away, go to [Developer Quick Start](/subgraphs/quick-start/).

## 概要

As a developer, you need data to build and power your dapp. Querying and indexing blockchain data is challenging, but The Graph provides a solution to this issue.

On The Graph, you can:

1. Create, deploy, and publish subgraphs to The Graph using Graph CLI and [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).
2. Use GraphQL to query existing subgraphs.

### What is GraphQL?

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) is the query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. The Graph uses GraphQL to query subgraphs.

### Developer Actions

- Query subgraphs built by other developers in [The Graph Network](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and integrate them into your own dapps.
- Create custom subgraphs to fulfill specific data needs, allowing improved scalability and flexibility for other developers.
- Deploy, publish and signal your subgraphs within The Graph Network.

### What are subgraphs?

A subgraph is a custom API built on blockchain data. It extracts data from a blockchain, processes it, and stores it so that it can be easily queried via GraphQL.

Check out the documentation on [subgraphs](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/) to learn specifics.
