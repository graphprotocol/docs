title: AssemblyScriptのよくある問題
---

There are certain [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) issues that are common to run into during Subgraph development. They range in debug difficulty, however, being aware of them may help. The following is a non-exhaustive list of these issues:

- `Private` class variables are not enforced in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/status.html#language-features). There is no way to protect class variables from being directly changed from the class object.
- スコープは[クロージャー関数](https://www.assemblyscript.org/status.html#on-closures)には継承されません。つまり、クロージャー関数の外で宣言された変数は使用できません。Developer Highlights #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8AW-lVfrA&t=3243s)に説明があります。
