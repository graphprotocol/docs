title: Como Iniciar o Seu Subgraph
---

## Visão geral

The Graph is home to thousands of Subgraphs already available for query, so check [The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and find one that already matches your needs.

When you create a [Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/), you create a custom open API that extracts data from a blockchain, processes it, stores it, and makes it easy to query via GraphQL.

Subgraph development ranges from simple scaffold Subgraphs to advanced, specifically tailored Subgraphs.

### Comece a Construir

Start the process and build a Subgraph that matches your needs:

1. [Como Instalar a CLI](/subgraphs/developing/creating/install-the-cli/) — Configure a sua infraestrutura
2. [Subgraph Manifest](/subgraphs/developing/creating/subgraph-manifest/) - Understand a Subgraph's key component
3. [Schema da GraphQL](/subgraphs/developing/creating/ql-schema/) — Escreva o seu schema
4. [Como Escrever Mapeamentos em AssemblyScript](/subgraphs/developing/creating/assemblyscript-mappings/) — Escreva os seus mapeamentos
5. [Advanced Features](/subgraphs/developing/creating/advanced/) - Customize your Subgraph with advanced features
