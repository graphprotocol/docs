This page summarizes some of the most common questions for developers building on The Graph.

## Subgraph Related

### 1. What is a Subgraph?

A Subgraph is a custom API built on blockchain data. Subgraphs are queried using the GraphQL query language and are deployed to a Graph Node using The Graph CLI. Once deployed and published to The Graph's decentralized network, Indexers process Subgraphs and make them available for Subgraph consumers to query.

### 2. What is the first step to create a Subgraph?

To successfully create a Subgraph, you will need to install The Graph CLI. Review the [Quick Start](/subgraphs/quick-start/) to get started. For detailed information, see [Creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

### 3. Can I still create a Subgraph if my smart contracts don't have events?

It is highly recommended that you structure your smart contracts to have events associated with data you are interested in querying. Event handlers in the Subgraph are triggered by contract events and are the fastest way to retrieve useful data.

If the contracts you work with do not contain events, your Subgraph can use call and block handlers to trigger indexing. However, this is not recommended, as performance will be significantly slower.

### 4. Can I change the GitHub account associated with my Subgraph?

No. Once a Subgraph is created, the associated GitHub account cannot be changed. Please make sure to carefully consider this before creating your Subgraph.

### 5. How do I update a Subgraph on mainnet?

You can deploy a new version of your Subgraph to Subgraph Studio using the CLI. This action maintains your Subgraph private, but once you’re happy with it, you can publish to Graph Explorer. This will create a new version of your Subgraph that Curators can start signaling on.

### 6. Is it possible to duplicate a Subgraph to another account or endpoint without redeploying?

You have to redeploy the Subgraph, but if the Subgraph ID (IPFS hash) doesn't change, it won't have to sync from the beginning.

### 7. How do I call a contract function or access a public state variable from my Subgraph mappings?

Take a look at `Access to smart contract` state inside the section [AssemblyScript API](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/api/#access-to-smart-contract-state).

### 8. Can I import `ethers.js` or other JS libraries into my Subgraph mappings?

Not currently, as mappings are written in AssemblyScript.

One possible alternative solution to this is to store raw data in entities and perform logic that requires JS libraries on the client.

### 9. Ao escutar vários contratos, é possível selecionar a ordem do contrato para escutar eventos?

Within a Subgraph, the events are always processed in the order they appear in the blocks, regardless of whether that is across multiple contracts or not.

### 10. Quais são as diferenças entre modelos e fontes de dados?

Templates allow you to create data sources quickly, while your Subgraph is indexing. Your contract might spawn new contracts as people interact with it. Since you know the shape of those contracts (ABI, events, etc.) upfront, you can define how you want to index them in a template. When they are spawned, your Subgraph will create a dynamic data source by supplying the contract address.

Check out the "Instantiating a data source template" section on: [Data Source Templates](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#data-source-templates).

### 11. Is it possible to set up a Subgraph using `graph init` from `graph-cli` with two contracts? Or should I manually add another dataSource in `subgraph.yaml` after running `graph init`?

Yes. On `graph init` command itself you can add multiple dataSources by entering contracts one after the other.

You can also use `graph add` command to add a new dataSource.

### 12. Em qual ordem os handlers de evento, bloco, e chamada são ativados para uma fonte de dados?

Primeiro, handlers de eventos e chamadas são organizados pelo índice de transações dentro do bloco. Handlers de evento e chamada dentro da mesma transação são organizados com uma convenção: handlers de eventos primeiro e depois handlers de chamadas, com cada tipo a respeitar a ordem em que são definidos no manifest. Handlers de blocos são executados após handlers de eventos e chamadas, na ordem em que são definidos no manifest. Estas regras de organizações estão sujeitas a mudanças.

Com a criação de novas fontes de dados dinâmicas, os handlers definidos para fontes de dados dinâmicas só começarão a processar após o processamento dos handlers das fontes, e se repetirão na mesma sequência sempre que acionados.

### 13. Como garantir que estou a usar a versão mais recente do graph-node para as minhas implantações locais?

Podes executar o seguinte comando:

```sh
docker pull graphprotocol/graph-node:latest
```

> Note: docker / docker-compose will always use whatever graph-node version was pulled the first time you ran it, so make sure you're up to date with the latest version of graph-node.

### 14. Qual é a forma recomendada de construir ids "autogeradas" para uma entidade ao lidar com eventos?

If only one entity is created during the event and if there's nothing better available, then the transaction hash + log index would be unique. You can obfuscate these by converting that to Bytes and then piping it through `crypto.keccak256` but this won't make it more unique.

### 15. Can I delete my Subgraph?

Yes, you can [delete](/subgraphs/developing/managing/deleting-a-subgraph/) and [transfer](/subgraphs/developing/managing/transferring-a-subgraph/) your Subgraph.

## Network Related

### 16. Quais redes são apoiadas pelo The Graph?

You can find the list of the supported networks [here](/supported-networks/).

### 17. Is it possible to differentiate between networks (mainnet, Sepolia, local) within event handlers?

Yes. You can do this by importing `graph-ts` as per the example below:

```javascript
import { dataSource } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts'

dataSource.network()
dataSource.address()
```

### 18. Vocês apoiam handlers de bloco e de chamadas no Sepolia?

Sim. O Sepolia apoia handlers de blocos, chamadas e eventos. Vale notar que handlers de eventos têm desempenho muito melhor do que os outros dois e têm apoio em todas as redes compatíveis com EVMs.

## Indexing & Querying Related

### 19. É possível especificar o bloco de onde a indexação deve começar?

Yes. `dataSources.source.startBlock` in the `subgraph.yaml` file specifies the number of the block that the dataSource starts indexing from. In most cases, we suggest using the block where the contract was created: [Start blocks](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#start-blocks)

### 20. What are some tips to increase the performance of indexing? My Subgraph is taking a very long time to sync

Yes, you should take a look at the optional start block feature to start indexing from the block where the contract was deployed: [Start blocks](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#start-blocks)

### 21. Is there a way to query the Subgraph directly to determine the latest block number it has indexed?

Sim! Execute o seguinte comando, com "organization/subgraphName" substituído com a organização sob a qual ele foi publicado e o nome do seu subgraph:

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{ "query": "{indexingStatusForCurrentVersion(subgraphName: \"organization/subgraphName\") { chains { latestBlock { hash number }}}}"}' https://api.thegraph.com/index-node/graphql
```

### 22. Há um limite de quantos objetos o Graph pode retornar por query?

Normalmente, respostas a queries são limitadas a 100 itens por coleção. Se quiser receber mais, pode subir para até 1000 itens por coleção; além disto, pode paginar com:

```graphql
someCollection(first: 1000, skip: <number>) { ... }
```

### 23. If my dapp frontend uses The Graph for querying, do I need to write my API key into the frontend directly? What if we pay query fees for users – will malicious users cause our query fees to be very high?

Currently, the recommended approach for a dapp is to add the key to the frontend and expose it to end users. That said, you can limit that key to a hostname, like _yourdapp.io_ and Subgraph. The gateway is currently being run by Edge & Node. Part of the responsibility of a gateway is to monitor for abusive behavior and block traffic from malicious clients.

## Miscellaneous

### 24. Is it possible to use Apollo Federation on top of graph-node?

Federation is not supported yet. At the moment, you can use schema stitching, either on the client or via a proxy service.
