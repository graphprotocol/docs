title: Transferring a Subgraph
---

Subgraphs published to the decentralized network have an NFT minted to the address that published the Subgraph. The NFT is based on a standard ERC721, which facilitates transfers between accounts on The Graph Network.

## Reminders

- Whoever owns the NFT controls the Subgraph.
- If the owner decides to sell or transfer the NFT, they will no longer be able to edit or update that Subgraph on the network.
- You can easily move control of a Subgraph to a multi-sig.
- A community member can create a Subgraph on behalf of a DAO.

## View Your Subgraph as an NFT

To view your Subgraph as an NFT, you can visit an NFT marketplace like **OpenSea**:

```
https://opensea.io/your-wallet-address
```

Ou um explorador de carteiras, como o **Rainbow.me**:

```
https://rainbow.me/your-wallet-addres
```
