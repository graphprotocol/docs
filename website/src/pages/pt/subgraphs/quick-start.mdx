Learn how to easily build, publish and query a [Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/developer-faq/#1-what-is-a-subgraph) on The Graph.

## Pré-requisitos

- Uma carteira de criptomoedas
- Um endereço de contrato inteligente numa [rede apoiada](/supported-networks/)
- Ter o [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) instalado
- Um gestor de pacotes da sua escolha (`npm`, `yarn` ou `pnpm`)

## Como Construir um Subgraph

### 1. Create a Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

Entre no [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) e conecte a sua carteira de criptomoedas.

Subgraph Studio lets you create, manage, deploy, and publish Subgraphs, as well as create and manage API keys.

Click "Create a Subgraph". It is recommended to name the Subgraph in Title Case: "Subgraph Name Chain Name".

### 2. Como instalar o Graph CLI

Execute um dos seguintes comandos na sua máquina local:

Uso de [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli@latest
```

Uso de [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### 3. Initialize your Subgraph

> You can find commands for your specific Subgraph on the Subgraph page in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

The `graph init` command will automatically create a scaffold of a Subgraph based on your contract's events.

The following command initializes your Subgraph from an existing contract:

```sh
graph init
```

Se o seu contrato for verificado no scanner de blocos respetivo onde foi implantado (por exemplo, [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)), a interface binária de aplicativo será criada na CLI.

When you initialize your Subgraph, the CLI will ask you for the following information:

- **Protocol**: Choose the protocol your Subgraph will be indexing data from.
- **Subgraph slug**: Create a name for your Subgraph. Your Subgraph slug is an identifier for your Subgraph.
- **Directory**: Choose a directory to create your Subgraph in.
- **Ethereum network** (optional): You may need to specify which EVM-compatible network your Subgraph will be indexing data from.
- **Endereço de contrato:** Localize o endereço do contrato inteligente do qual quer solicitar dados por queries.
- **ABI (interface binária de aplicativo):** Se a ABI não estiver preenchida automaticamente, insira-a manualmente como um arquivo JSON.
- **Start Block**: You should input the start block to optimize Subgraph indexing of blockchain data. Locate the start block by finding the block where your contract was deployed.
- **Nome do Contrato:** Insira o nome do seu contrato.
- **Index contract events as entities**: It is suggested that you set this to true, as it will automatically add mappings to your Subgraph for every emitted event.
- **Adicionar outro contrato** (opcional): também é possível adicionar outro contrato.

See the following screenshot for an example for what to expect when initializing your Subgraph:

![Comando do subgraph](/img/CLI-Example.png)

### 4. Edit your Subgraph

The `init` command in the previous step creates a scaffold Subgraph that you can use as a starting point to build your Subgraph.

When making changes to the Subgraph, you will mainly work with three files:

- Manifest (`subgraph.yaml`) - defines what data sources your Subgraph will index.
- Schema (`schema.graphql`) - defines what data you wish to retrieve from the Subgraph.
- Mapeamentos em AssemblyScript (`mapping.ts`) — traduz dados das suas fontes de dados às entidades definidas no schema.

For a detailed breakdown on how to write your Subgraph, check out [Creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

### 5. Deploy your Subgraph

> Lembre-se: implantar não é o mesmo que editar.

When you **deploy** a Subgraph, you push it to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/), where you can test, stage and review it. A deployed Subgraph's indexing is performed by the [Upgrade Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/upgrade-indexer/), which is a single Indexer owned and operated by Edge & Node, rather than by the many decentralized Indexers in The Graph Network. A **deployed** Subgraph is free to use, rate-limited, not visible to the public, and meant to be used for development, staging, and testing purposes.

Once your Subgraph is written, run the following commands:

````
```sh
graph codegen && graph build
```
````

Authenticate and deploy your Subgraph. The deploy key can be found on the Subgraph's page in Subgraph Studio.

![Chave de implantação](/img/subgraph-studio-deploy-key.jpg)

````
```sh

graph auth <DEPLOY_KEY>

graph deploy <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```
````

A CLI solicitará um rótulo de versão. Recomendamos fortemente que use [controle semântico de versão](https://semver.org/); por exemplo, `0.0.1`.

### 6. Review your Subgraph

If you’d like to test your Subgraph before publishing it, you can use [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to do the following:

- Executar um exemplo de query.
- Analyze your Subgraph in the dashboard to check information.
- Check the logs on the dashboard to see if there are any errors with your Subgraph. The logs of an operational Subgraph will look like this:

  ![Logs do subgraph](/img/subgraph-logs-image.png)

### 7. Publish your Subgraph to The Graph Network

When your Subgraph is ready for a production environment, you can publish it to the decentralized network. Publishing is an onchain action that does the following:

- It makes your Subgraph available to be to indexed by the decentralized [Indexers](/indexing/overview/) on The Graph Network.
- It removes rate limits and makes your Subgraph publicly searchable and queryable in [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/).
- It makes your Subgraph available for [Curators](/resources/roles/curating/) to curate it.

> The greater the amount of GRT you and others curate on your Subgraph, the more Indexers will be incentivized to index your Subgraph, improving the quality of service, reducing latency, and enhancing network redundancy for your Subgraph.

#### Como Editar com o Subgraph Studio

To publish your Subgraph, click the Publish button in the dashboard.

![Publish a Subgraph on Subgraph Studio](/img/publish-sub-transfer.png)

Select the network to which you would like to publish your Subgraph.

#### Publicação da CLI

As of version 0.73.0, you can also publish your Subgraph with the Graph CLI.

Abra a `graph-cli`.

Use os seguintes comandos:

````
```sh
graph codegen && graph build
```

Depois,

```sh
graph publish
```
````

3. A window will open, allowing you to connect your wallet, add metadata, and deploy your finalized Subgraph to a network of your choice.

Para personalizar a sua implantação, veja [Como Editar um Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/).

#### Adding signal to your Subgraph

1. To attract Indexers to query your Subgraph, you should add GRT curation signal to it.

   - This action improves quality of service, reduces latency, and enhances network redundancy and availability for your Subgraph.

2. Se tiverem direito a recompensas por indexação, os Indexadores recebem recompensas em GRT com base na quantia sinalizada.

   - It’s recommended to curate at least 3,000 GRT to attract 3 Indexers. Check reward eligibility based on Subgraph feature usage and supported networks.

Para saber mais sobre curadoria, clique [aqui](/resources/roles/curating/).

To save on gas costs, you can curate your Subgraph in the same transaction you publish it by selecting this option:

### 8. Query your Subgraph

You now have access to 100,000 free queries per month with your Subgraph on The Graph Network!

You can query your Subgraph by sending GraphQL queries to its Query URL, which you can find by clicking the Query button.

For more information about querying data from your Subgraph, read [Querying The Graph](/subgraphs/querying/introduction/).
