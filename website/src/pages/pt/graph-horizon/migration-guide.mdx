For updated progress and schedule for the upgrade please [Graph Horizon: Mainnet schedule](https://www.notion.so/edgeandnode/Graph-Horizon-Mainnet-schedule-2928686fc7c28058b906fb6c6dfbdb63?source=copy_link).

## Who Needs to Take Action?

The Graph Horizon upgrade has been designed to minimize disruption across the network. Here's what different participants need to know:

### Indexadores

**Action Required**: Indexers must upgrade their infrastructure to support Graph Horizon.

The upgrade involves updating indexer software components and infrastructure to be compatible with the new Horizon architecture.

🚨 **Important**: Graph Horizon is a breaking change to the protocol. Indexers who do not upgrade will eventually lose access to indexing rewards and query fees. Existing allocations opened before Graph Horizon will continue to accrue rewards and fees, but non-upgraded indexers will be unable to open new allocations.

For detailed upgrade instructions, see the [Indexer Upgrade Guide](https://www.notion.so/edgeandnode/Graph-Horizon-indexer-stack-upgrade-guide-2658686fc7c2808984fbcc55e535e3b2?source=copy_link).

### Delegantes

**No Action Required**: Delegations will continue to work seamlessly.

Your delegated stake will automatically transition to the new Horizon system, specifically it will be assigned to the `SubgraphService` data service for the original indexer that was delegated to. You don't need to undelegate, re-delegate, or make any changes to your existing delegations.

### Curators

**No Action Required**: Curation signals will be preserved.

All existing curation signals on subgraphs will remain intact and continue to function as expected in the Horizon upgrade. No action is needed from curators.

### End Users & Developers

**No Action Required**: Subgraph queries will continue without interruption.

Applications querying subgraphs will experience no disruption. The upgrade is designed to be transparent to end users and developers building on The Graph.
