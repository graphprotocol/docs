Token API MCP server is an open-source implementation of [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

This MCP server makes on-chain token data, including metadata, balances, transfers, and holder statistics, accessible through a set of MCP tools. Any compatible client can use these tools to fetch and analyze token information through a standardized interface. It connects to The Graph's hosted Token API database, enabling AI assistants to query blockchain data using natural language requests.

There is one MCP option available:

- A REST-based MCP, the default, that communicates with the Token API.

The REST-based MCP simply exposes the API endpoints to your LLM based on the OpenAPI specification (available at https://token-api.thegraph.com/openapi). It is the _recommended way_ to set up an LLM with Token API as the set of tools it offers is straightforward to use for any language model. Additionnaly, it automatically stays up-to-date with new Token API releases so you don't miss any new features!

## What You Can Do

- Retrieve token metadata including name, symbol, decimals, total supply, and contract address
- Get token balances for any wallet address holding a supported ERC-20 token
- Fetch token transfer activity including sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp
- Identify top holders and analyze token distribution
- Ask natural language questions about token data without writing smart contract calls
- Access historical transfer data to analyze token movement over time

The Token MCP server provides [Claude](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/claude/), [Cline](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/cline/), [Cursor](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/cursor/) and any other client with MCP integration a direct, conversational access to onchain token data.
