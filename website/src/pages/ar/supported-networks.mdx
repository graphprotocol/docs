- Subgraph Studio relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, for example JSON-RPC, Firehose and Substreams endpoints.
- Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier.
- If a Subgraph was published via the CLI and picked up by an Indexer, it could technically be queried even without support, and efforts are underway to further streamline integration of new networks.
- For a full list of which features are supported on the decentralized network, see [this page](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md).

## Running Graph Node locally

If your preferred network isn't supported on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph Node can also index other protocols, via a Firehose integration. Firehose integrations have been created for NEAR and Arweave. Additionally, Graph Node can support Substreams-powered Subgraphs for any network with Substreams support.
