title: Transfer to The Graph
---

Quickly upgrade your Subgraphs from any platform to [The Graph's decentralized network](https://thegraph.com/networks/).

## Benefits of Switching to The Graph

- Use the same Subgraph that your apps already use with zero-downtime migration.
- Increase reliability from a global network supported by 100+ Indexers.
- Receive lightning-fast support for Subgraphs 24/7, with an on-call engineering team.

## Upgrade Your Subgraph to The Graph in 3 Easy Steps

1. [Set Up Your Studio Environment](/subgraphs/cookbook/transfer-to-the-graph/#1-set-up-your-studio-environment)
2. [Deploy Your Subgraph to Studio](/subgraphs/cookbook/transfer-to-the-graph/#2-deploy-your-subgraph-to-studio)
3. [Publish to The Graph Network](/subgraphs/cookbook/transfer-to-the-graph/#publish-your-subgraph-to-the-graphs-decentralized-network)

## 1. Set Up Your Studio Environment

### Create a Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

- Go to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and connect your wallet.
- Click "Create a Subgraph". It is recommended to name the Subgraph in Title Case: "Subgraph Name Chain Name".

> Note: After publishing, the Subgraph name will be editable but requires onchain action each time, so name it properly.

### Install the Graph CLI⁠

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and a package manager of your choice (`npm` or `pnpm`) installed to use the Graph CLI. Check for the [most recent](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling/releases?q=%40graphprotocol%2Fgraph-cli&expanded=true) CLI version.

On your local machine, run the following command:

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) کا استعمال:

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli@latest
```

Use the following command to create a Subgraph in Studio using the CLI:

```sh
graph init --product subgraph-studio
```

### Authenticate Your Subgraph

In The Graph CLI, use the auth command seen in Subgraph Studio:

```sh
graph auth <your-auth-code>
```

## 2. Deploy Your Subgraph to Studio

If you have your source code, you can easily deploy it to Studio. If you don't have it, here's a quick way to deploy your Subgraph.

In The Graph CLI, run the following command:

```sh
graph deploy <slug> --ipfs-hash <your-subgraph-ipfs-hash>

```

> **Note:** Every Subgraph has an IPFS hash (Deployment ID), which looks like this: "Qmasdfad...". To deploy simply use this **IPFS hash**. You’ll be prompted to enter a version (e.g., v0.0.1).

## 3. Publish Your Subgraph to The Graph Network

### Query Your Subgraph

> To attract about 3 indexers to query your Subgraph, it’s recommended to curate at least 3,000 GRT. To learn more about curating, check out [Curating](/resources/roles/curating/) on The Graph.

You can start [querying](/subgraphs/querying/introduction/) any Subgraph by sending a GraphQL query into the Subgraph’s query URL endpoint, which is located at the top of its Explorer page in Subgraph Studio.

#### مثال

[CryptoPunks Ethereum Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/HdVdERFUe8h61vm2fDyycHgxjsde5PbB832NHgJfZNqK) by Messari:

![Query URL](/img/cryptopunks-screenshot-transfer.png)

The query URL for this Subgraph is:

```sh
https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/`**your-own-api-key**`/subgraphs/id/HdVdERFUe8h61vm2fDyycgxjsde5PbB832NHgJfZNqK
```

Now, you simply need to fill in **your own API Key** to start sending GraphQL queries to this endpoint.

### Getting your own API Key

You can create API Keys in Subgraph Studio under the “API Keys” menu at the top of the page:

![API keys](/img/Api-keys-screenshot.png)

### Monitor Subgraph Status

Once you upgrade, you can access and manage your Subgraphs in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and explore all Subgraphs in [The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/networks/).
