## گراف کیا ہے؟

The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data across [90+ networks](/supported-networks/).

Its data services include:

- [Subgraphs](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/): Open APIs to query blockchain data that can be created or queried by anyone.
- [Substreams](/substreams/introduction/): High-performance data streams for real-time blockchain processing, built with modular components.
- [Token API Beta](/token-api/quick-start/): Instant access to standardized token data requiring zero setup.

### Why Blockchain Data is Difficult to Query

Reading data from blockchains requires processing smart contract events, parsing metadata from IPFS, and manually aggregating data.

The result is slow performance, complex infrastructure, and scalability issues.

## How The Graph Solves This

The Graph uses a combination of cutting-edge research, core dev expertise, and independent Indexers to make blockchain data accessible for developers.

Find the perfect data service for you:

### 1. Custom Real-Time Data Streams

**Use Case:** High-frequency trading, live analytics.

- [Build Substreams](/substreams/introduction/)
- [Browse Community Substreams](https://substreams.dev/)

### 2. Instant Token Data

**Use Case:** Wallet balances, liquidity pools, transfer events.

- [Start with Token API](/token-api/quick-start/)

### 3. Flexible Historical Queries

**Use Case:** Dapp frontends, custom analytics.
