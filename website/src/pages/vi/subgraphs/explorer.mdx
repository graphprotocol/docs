Use [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and take full advantage of its core features.

## Tổng quan

This guide explains how to use [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) to quickly discover and interact with Subgraphs on The Graph Network, delegate GRT, view participant metrics, and analyze network performance.

> When you visit Graph Explorer, you can also access the link to [explore Substreams](https://substreams.dev/).

## Prerequisites

- To perform actions, you need a wallet (e.g., MetaMask) connected to [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer).
  > Make sure your wallet is connected to the correct network (e.g., Arbitrum). Features and data shown are network specific.
- GRT tokens if you plan to delegate or curate.
- Basic knowledge of [Subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/)

## Navigating Graph Explorer

### Step 1. Explore Subgraphs

> For additional support, you can watch the [Graph Explorer video guide](/subgraphs/explorer/#video-guide).

Go to the Subgraphs page in [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer).

- If you've deployed and published your Subgraph in Subgraph Studio, you can view it here.
- Search all published Subgraphs and filter them by indexed network, specific categories (such as DeFI, NFTs, and DAOs), and **most queried, most curated, recently created, and recently updated**.

![Graph Explorer Subgraphs page](/img/explorer-subgraphs-page.png)

To find Subgraphs indexing a specific contract, enter the contract address into the search bar.

- For example, you can enter the L2GNS contract on Artbitrum (`0xec9A7fb6CbC2E41926127929c2dcE6e9c5D33Bec`) and this returns all Subgraphs indexing that contract:

![Search by Indexing Contract](/img/explorer-search.png)

> Looking for indexing contracts? Check out [this Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/FMTUN6d7sY2bLnAmNEPJTqiU3iuQht6ZXurpBh71wbWR?view=About&chain=arbitrum-one) which indexes contract addresses listed in its manifest. It shows all current deployments indexing those contracts on Arbitrum One, along with the signal allocated to each.

You can click into any Subgraph, to:

- Test queries in the playground and be able to leverage network details to make informed decisions.
- Signal GRT on your own Subgraph or the Subgraphs of others to make Indexers aware of its importance and quality.
  > This is critical because signaling on a Subgraph incentivizes it to be indexed, meaning it'll eventually surface on the network to serve queries.

![Subgraph Details](/img/explorer-subgraph-details.png)

On each Subgraph’s dedicated page, you can do the following:

- Query Subgraphs via GraphQL
- View Subgraph ID, current deployment ID, Query URL, and other metadata
- Signal/unsignal on Subgraphs
- Test Subgraphs in the playground
- View the Indexers that are indexing on a certain Subgraph
- Thống kê Subgraph (phân bổ, Curators, v.v.)
- View query fees and charts
- Change versions to explore past iterations of the Subgraph
- View entity types
- View Subgraph activity

![Signal/unsignal on Subgraph](/img/explorer-signal.png)

### Step 2. Delegate GRT

Go to the [Delegate](https://thegraph.com/explorer/delegate?chain=arbitrum-one) page to learn how to delegate, get GRT, and choose an Indexer.

Here, you can:

- Compare Indexers by most query fees earned and highest estimated APR.
- Use the built-in ROI calculator or search by Indexer name or address.
- Click **"Delegate"** next to an Indexer to stake your GRT.

### Step 3. Monitor Participants in the Network

Go to the [Participants](https://thegraph.com/explorer/participants?chain=arbitrum-one) page to view:

- Indexers: stakes, allocations, rewards, and delegation parameters
- Curators: signal amounts, Subgraph shares, and activity history
- Delegators: current and historical delegations, rewards, and Indexer metrics

#### Indexers

![Indexers Table](/img/explorer-indexers.png)

Indexers are the backbone of the protocol. They stake on Subgraphs, index them, and serve queries to anyone consuming Subgraphs.

In the Indexers table, you can see an Indexer's delegation parameters, their stake, how much they have staked to each Subgraph, and how much revenue they have made from query fees and indexing rewards.

**Specifics**

- Query Fee Cut: The % of the query fee rebates that the Indexer keeps when splitting with Delegators.
- Effective Reward Cut: The indexing reward cut applied to the delegation pool. If it’s negative, it means that the Indexer is giving away part of their rewards. If it’s positive, it means that the Indexer is keeping some of their rewards.
- Cooldown Remaining: The time remaining until the Indexer can change the above delegation parameters. Cooldown periods are set up by Indexers when they update their delegation parameters.
- Owned: This is the Indexer’s deposited stake, which may be slashed for malicious or incorrect behavior.
- Delegated: Stake from Delegators which can be allocated by the Indexer, but cannot be slashed.
- Allocated: Stake that Indexers are actively allocating towards the Subgraphs they are indexing.
- Available Delegation Capacity: The amount of delegated stake the Indexers can still receive before they become over-delegated.
- Max Delegation Capacity: The maximum amount of delegated stake the Indexer can productively accept. An excess delegated stake cannot be used for allocations or rewards calculations.
- Query Fees: This is the total fees that end users have paid for queries from an Indexer over all time.
- Indexer Rewards: This is the total indexer rewards earned by the Indexer and their Delegators over all time. Indexer rewards are paid through GRT issuance.

Indexers can earn both query fees and indexing rewards. Functionally, this happens when network participants delegate GRT to an Indexer. This enables Indexers to receive query fees and rewards depending on their Indexer parameters.

- Indexing parameters can be set by clicking on the right-hand side of the table or by going into an Indexer’s profile and clicking the “Delegate” button.

To learn more about how to become an Indexer, you can take a look at the [official documentation](/indexing/overview/) or [The Graph Academy Indexer guides.](https://thegraph.academy/delegators/choosing-indexers/)

![Indexing Details Pane](/img/Indexing-Details-Pane.png)

#### Curators

Curators analyze Subgraphs to identify which Subgraphs are of the highest quality. Once a Curator has found a potentially high-quality Subgraph, they can curate it by signaling on its bonding curve. In doing so, Curators let Indexers know which Subgraphs are high quality and should be indexed.

- Curators can be community members, data consumers, or even Subgraph developers who signal on their own Subgraphs by depositing GRT tokens into a bonding curve.
  - By depositing GRT, Curators mint curation shares of a Subgraph. As a result, they can earn a portion of the query fees generated by the Subgraph they have signaled on.
  - The bonding curve incentivizes Curators to curate the highest quality data sources.

In the The Curator table listed below you can see:

- Ngày Curator bắt đầu curate
- Số GRT đã được nạp
- Số cổ phần một Curator sở hữu

![Curators Table](/img/explorer-curators.png)

If you want to learn more about the Curator role, you can do so by visiting [official documentation.](/resources/roles/curating/) or [The Graph Academy](https://thegraph.academy/curators/).

#### Delegators

Delegators play a key role in maintaining the security and decentralization of The Graph Network. They participate in the network by delegating (i.e., “staking”) GRT tokens to one or multiple indexers.

- Without Delegators, Indexers are less likely to earn significant rewards and fees. Therefore, Indexers attract Delegators by offering them a portion of their indexing rewards and query fees.
- Delegators select Indexers based on a number of different variables, such as past performance, indexing reward rates, and query fee cuts.
- Reputation within the community can also play a factor in the selection process. It's recommended to connect with the selected Indexers via [The Graph's Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol) or [The Graph Forum](https://forum.thegraph.com/).

![Delegators Table](/img/explorer-delegators.png)

In the Delegators table you can see the active Delegators in the community and important metrics:

- Số lượng Indexers mà một Delegator đang ủy quyền cho
- A Delegator's original delegation
- Phần thưởng họ đã tích lũy nhưng chưa rút khỏi giao thức
- Phần thưởng đã ghi nhận ra mà họ rút khỏi giao thức
- Tổng lượng GRT mà họ hiện có trong giao thức
- The date they last delegated

If you want to learn more about how to become a Delegator, check out the [official documentation](/resources/roles/delegating/delegating/) or [The Graph Academy](https://docs.thegraph.academy/official-docs/delegator/choosing-indexers).

### Step 4. Analyze Network Performance

On the [Network](https://thegraph.com/explorer/network?chain=arbitrum-one) page, you can see global KPIs and have the ability to switch to a per-epoch basis and analyze network metrics in more detail. These details will give you a sense of how the network is performing over time.

#### Tổng quan

The overview section has both all the current network metrics and some cumulative metrics over time:

- Tổng stake mạng hiện tại
- Phần chia stake giữa Indexer và các Delegator của họ
- Tổng cung GRT, lượng được đúc và đốt kể từ khi mạng lưới thành lập
- Tổng phần thưởng Indexing kể từ khi bắt đầu giao thức
- Các thông số giao thức như phần thưởng curation, tỷ lệ lạm phát,...
- Phần thưởng và phí của epoch hiện tại

A few key details to note:

- **Query fees represent the fees generated by the consumers**. They can be claimed (or not) by the Indexers after a period of at least 7 epochs (see below) after their allocations towards the Subgraphs have been closed and the data they served has been validated by the consumers.
- **Indexing rewards represent the amount of rewards the Indexers claimed from the network issuance during the epoch.** Although the protocol issuance is fixed, the rewards only get minted once Indexers close their allocations towards the Subgraphs they’ve been indexing. So, the per-epoch number of rewards varies (ie. during some epochs, Indexers might’ve collectively closed allocations that have been open for many days).

![Network Overview](/img/explorer-network.png)

#### Epochs

In the Epochs section, you can analyze on a per-epoch basis, metrics such as:

- Khối bắt đầu hoặc kết thúc của Epoch
- Phí truy vấn được tạo và phần thưởng indexing được thu thập trong một epoch cụ thể
- Trạng thái Epoch, đề cập đến việc thu và phân phối phí truy vấn và có thể có các trạng thái khác nhau:
  - Epoch đang hoạt động là epoch mà Indexer hiện đang phân bổ cổ phần và thu phí truy vấn
  - Epoch đang giải quyết là những epoch mà các kênh trạng thái đang được giải quyết. Điều này có nghĩa là Indexers có thể bị phạt cắt giảm nếu người tiêu dùng công khai tranh chấp chống lại họ.
  - Epoch đang phân phối là epoch trong đó các kênh trạng thái cho các epoch đang được giải quyết và Indexer có thể yêu cầu hoàn phí truy vấn của họ.
  - The finalized epochs are the epochs that have no query fee rebates left to claim by the Indexers.

## Access and Manage Your User Profile

### Step 1. Access Your Profile

- Click your wallet address in the top right corner
- Your wallet acts as your user profile
- In your profile dashboard, you can view and interact with several useful tabs

### Step 2. Explore the Tabs

#### Tổng quan Hồ sơ

In this section, you can view the following:

- Your activity
- Your profile information: total query fees, total shares value, owned stake, stake delegating

![Profile Overview](/img/Profile-Overview.png)

#### Tab Subgraphs

The Subgraphs tab displays all your published Subgraphs.

> Subgraphs deployed with the CLI for testing purposes will not show up here. Subgraphs will only show up when they are published to the decentralized network.

![Subgraphs Overview](/img/Subgraphs-Overview.png)

#### Tab Indexing

> If you haven't indexed, you will see links to stake to index Subgraphs and browse Subgraphs on Graph Explorer.

The Indexing tab displays a table where you can review active and historical allocations to Subgraphs.

Track your Indexer performance with visual charts and key metrics, including:

- Delegated Stake: Stake from Delegators that can be allocated by you but cannot be slashed.
- Total Query Fees: Cumulative fees from served queries.
- Indexer Rewards (in GRT): Total rewards earned.
- Fee Cut & Rewards Cut: The % of query fee rebates and Indexer rewards you'll keep when you split with Delegators.
- Owned Stake: Your deposited stake, which could be slashed for malicious or incorrect behavior.

![Indexer Stats](/img/Indexer-Stats.png)

#### Tab Delegating

> To learn more about the benefits of delegating, check out [delegating](/resources/roles/delegating/delegating/).

The Delegators tab displays your active and historical delegations, along with the metrics for the Indexers you've delegated to.

Top Section:

- View delegation and rewards-only charts
- Track key metrics:
  - Total delegation rewards
  - Unrealized rewards
  - Realized Rewards

Bottom Section:

- Explore a table of your Indexer delegations, including reward cuts, cooldowns, and more.
- Use the buttons on the right side of the table to manage your delegation - delegate more, undelegate, or withdraw it after the thawing period.

> This table is horizontally scrollable, so scroll right to see delegation status: delegating, undelegating, or withdrawable.

![Delegation Stats](/img/Delegation-Stats.png)

#### Tab Curating

The Curation tab displays all the Subgraphs you’re signaling on (thus enabling you to receive query fees). Signaling allows Curators to highlight to Indexers which Subgraphs are valuable and trustworthy, thus signaling that they need to be indexed on.

Trong tab này, bạn sẽ tìm thấy tổng quan về:

- All the Subgraphs you're curating on with signal details
- Share totals per Subgraph
- Query rewards per Subgraph
- Chi tiết ngày được cập nhật

![Curation Stats](/img/Curation-Stats.png)

#### Cài đặt Hồ sơ của bạn

Trong hồ sơ người dùng của mình, bạn sẽ có thể quản lý chi tiết hồ sơ cá nhân của mình (như thiết lập tên ENS). Nếu bạn là Indexer, bạn thậm chí có nhiều quyền truy cập hơn vào các cài đặt trong tầm tay của mình. Trong hồ sơ người dùng của mình, bạn sẽ có thể thiết lập các tham số ủy quyền và operator của mình.

- Operators (Người vận hành) thực hiện các hành động được hạn chế trong giao thức thay mặt cho Indexer, chẳng hạn như mở và đóng phân bổ. Operators thường là các địa chỉ Ethereum khác, tách biệt với ví đặt staking của họ, với quyền truy cập được kiểm soát vào mạng mà Indexer có thể cài đặt cá nhân
- Tham số ủy quyền cho phép bạn kiểm soát việc phân phối GRT giữa bạn và các Delegator của bạn.

![Profile Settings](/img/Profile-Settings.png)

As your official portal into the world of decentralized data, Graph Explorer allows you to take a variety of actions, no matter your role in the network. You can get to your profile settings by opening the dropdown menu next to your address, then clicking on the Settings button.
