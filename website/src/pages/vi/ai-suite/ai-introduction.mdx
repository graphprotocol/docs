title: The Graph's AI

Build with speed and scale faster with The Graph's AI.

## Using AI on The Graph

Instead of relying on static datasets or centralized APIs, you can now access live blockchain data through our **agentic** app, [Graph Assistant](/ai-suite/graph-assistant/introduction/), and use our AI-native tooling, [Subgraph MCP](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/introduction/), and [Token API MCP](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/introduction/).

### Why Use Onchain Data with AI?

Using onchain data with AI unlocks powerful new ways to interact with and understand blockchain ecosystems.

- **AI for Non-Technical End Users**: AI can turn complex onchain data into accessible insights. Assistants powered by AI enable you to explore and analyze blockchain data without coding.
- **AI for Developers**: You can use AI to interact directly with The Graph's data through your agents or build AI-powered applications on top of it. This streamlines development and opens up more intuitive, dynamic use cases.

## AI for Non-Technical/End Users

[Graph Assistant](/ai-suite/graph-assistant/introduction/) is a powerful **agentic** application that empowers users to easily interact with blockchain data. Ask questions in simple, natural language and get rich, AI powered insights. Both technical developers and non-technical product teams can move faster, make smarter decisions, and gain a clearer understanding than ever before.

### Benefits of Using Graph Assistant

- **Natural language Input**: You don't need to write complex queries or sift through dashboards. Simply ask your question in plain English and get clear, structured results.
- **Multi-source support**: Works across multiple Subgraphs and Token API. The Assistant automatically determines which data source to use, so you don't have to switch tools or manage endpoints.
- **Schema-free access**: You don't need to understand the schema. You can refer to tokens, protocols, dates, or addresses using natural language. The Assistant takes care of the rest.

### Conversational Querying with Graph Assistant

**Example queries:**

- "List the top-5 swaps by USD value in the last 24 hours."
- "Give me the daily volume on Uniswap."
- "List the 20 most recently registered .eth names."

[Graph Assistant](/ai-suite/graph-assistant/introduction/) will eventually be a one-stop shop for interacting with The Graph. Right now, it's an agentic AI app that uses state-of-the-art AI techniques, LLMs, and MCPs to understand and answer your questions about [Subgraphs](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/) and [Token API](/token-api/quick-start/) data.

## AI for Developers

### Enable Natural Language Access to Onchain Data

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) servers connect to Claude, Cline, and Cursor. They enable models to understand, query, and interact with structured onchain data using natural language. MCPs remove the need to write low-level queries or interact with APIs directly.

### Subgraph MCP

The [Subgraph MCP](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/introduction/) server connects models to Subgraphs on The Graph Network. It allows language models to explore Subgraph schemas, execute GraphQL queries, find relevant Subgraphs by keyword or contract, and surface usage metrics using natural language.

### Token API MCP

The [Token API MCP](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/introduction/) MCP server enables models to access onchain token data. It supports querying token metadata, wallet balances, transfer history, and top token holders through simple prompts.

#### Benefits of Using Subgraph and Token API MCPs

- Query Subgraphs and token data using natural language
- Access GraphQL schemas and token metadata without manual queries
- Find Subgraphs by keyword or contract and check 30-day usage
- Retrieve real-time data from The Graph and onchain token sources
- Get wallet balances, transfer history, and top token holders
