title: Claude MCP
---

This guide walks you through configuring Claude Desktop to use The Graph ecosystem's [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) resources: Token API and Subgraph. These integrations allow you to interact with blockchain data through natural language conversations with Claude.

## What You Can Do

With these integrations, you can:

- **Token API**: Access token and wallet information across multiple blockchains
- **Subgraph**: Find relevant Subgraphs for specific keywords and contracts, explore Subgraph schemas, and execute GraphQL queries

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed and available in your path
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- API keys:
  - Token API key from [The Graph Market](https://thegraph.market/)
  - Gateway API key from [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/)

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Open Configuration File

Navigate to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

> **Claude Desktop** > **Settings** > **Developer** > **Edit Config**

Paths by operating system:

- OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### 2. Add Configuration

Replace the contents of the existing config file with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "token-api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pinax/mcp", "--sse-url", "https://token-api.mcp.thegraph.com/sse"],
      "env": {
        "ACCESS_TOKEN": "ACCESS_TOKEN"
      }
    },
    "subgraph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "--header", "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}", "https://subgraphs.mcp.thegraph.com/sse"],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer GATEWAY_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Add Your API Keys

Replace:

- `ACCESS_TOKEN` with your Token API key from [The Graph Market](https://thegraph.market/)
- `GATEWAY_API_KEY` with your Gateway API key from [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/)

### 4. Save and Restart

- Save the configuration file
- Restart Claude Desktop

### 5. Add The Graph Resources in Claude

After configuration:

1. Start a new conversation in Claude Desktop
2. Click on the context menu (top right)
3. Add "Subgraph Server Instructions" as a resource by entering `graphql://subgraph` for Subgraph MCP

> **Important**: You must manually add The Graph resources to your chat context for each conversation where you want to use them.

### 6. Run Queries

Here are some example queries you can try after setting up the resources:

### Subgraph Queries

```
What are the top pools in Uniswap?
```

```
Who are the top Delegators of The Graph Protocol?
```

```
Please make a bar chart for the number of active loans in Compound for the last 7 days
```

### Token API Queries

```
Show me the current price of ETH
```

```
What are the top tokens by market cap on Ethereum?
```

```
Analyze this wallet address: 0x...
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Verify Node.js Installation**: Ensure Node.js is correctly installed by running `node -v` in your terminal
2. **Check API Keys**: Verify that your API keys are correctly entered in the configuration file
3. **Enable Verbose Logging**: Add `--verbose true` to the args array in your configuration to see detailed logs
4. **Restart Claude Desktop**: After making changes to the configuration, always restart Claude Desktop
