Token API MCP server is an open-source implementation of [Anthropic's Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

This MCP server makes on-chain token data, including metadata, balances, transfers, and holder statistics, accessible through a set of MCP tools. Any compatible client can use these tools to fetch and analyze token information through a standardized interface. It connects to The Graph's hosted Token API database, enabling AI assistants to query real-time blockchain data using natural language requests that get translated into optimized SQL queries.

The server itself does not host any language model. It simply converts MCP calls into data look-ups and returns structured results, letting the client's own LLM incorporate the results.

Think of it as a USB-C hub: it standardizes the plug-and-play connection between AI agents and The Graph's Token API data.

## What You Can Do

- Retrieve token metadata including name, symbol, decimals, total supply, and contract address
- Get token balances for any wallet address holding a supported ERC-20 token
- Fetch token transfer activity including sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp
- Identify top holders and analyze token distribution
- Ask natural language questions about token data without writing smart contract calls
- Access historical transfer data to analyze token movement over time

The Token MCP server provides [Claude](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/claude/), [Cline](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/cline/), and [Cursor](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/cursor/) with direct, conversational access to onchain token data.
