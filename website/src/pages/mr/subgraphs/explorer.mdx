Unlock the world of Subgraphs and network data with [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer).

## सविश्लेषण

Graph Explorer consists of multiple parts where you can interact with [Subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/explorer?chain=arbitrum-one), [delegate](https://thegraph.com/explorer/delegate?chain=arbitrum-one), engage [participants](https://thegraph.com/explorer/participants?chain=arbitrum-one), view [network information](https://thegraph.com/explorer/network?chain=arbitrum-one), and access your user profile.

## Inside Explorer

The following is a breakdown of all the key features of Graph Explorer. For additional support, you can watch the [Graph Explorer video guide](/subgraphs/explorer/#video-guide).

### Subgraphs Page

After deploying and publishing your Subgraph in Subgraph Studio, go to [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and click on the "[Subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/explorer?chain=arbitrum-one)" link in the navigation bar to access the following:

- Your own finished Subgraphs
- Subgraphs published by others
- The exact Subgraph you want (based on the date created, signal amount, or name).

![Explorer Image 1](/img/Subgraphs-Explorer-Landing.png)

When you click into a Subgraph, you will be able to do the following:

- Test queries in the playground and be able to leverage network details to make informed decisions.
- Signal GRT on your own Subgraph or the Subgraphs of others to make indexers aware of its importance and quality.

  - This is critical because signaling on a Subgraph incentivizes it to be indexed, meaning it’ll eventually surface on the network to serve queries.

![Explorer Image 2](/img/Subgraph-Details.png)

On each Subgraph’s dedicated page, you can do the following:

- Signal/Un-signal on Subgraphs
- चार्ट, वर्तमान उपयोजन आयडी आणि इतर मेटाडेटा यासारखे अधिक तपशील पहा
- Switch versions to explore past iterations of the Subgraph
- Query Subgraphs via GraphQL
- Test Subgraphs in the playground
- View the Indexers that are indexing on a certain Subgraph
- Subgraph stats (allocations, Curators, etc)
- View the entity who published the Subgraph

![Explorer Image 3](/img/Explorer-Signal-Unsignal.png)

### Delegate Page

On the [Delegate page](https://thegraph.com/explorer/delegate?chain=arbitrum-one), you can find information about delegating, acquiring GRT, and choosing an Indexer.

On this page, you can see the following:

- Indexers who collected the most query fees
- Indexers with the highest estimated APR

Additionally, you can calculate your ROI and search for top Indexers by name, address, or Subgraph.

### Participants Page

This page provides a bird's-eye view of all "participants," which includes everyone participating in the network, such as Indexers, Delegators, and Curators.

#### 1. Indexers

![Explorer Image 4](/img/Indexer-Pane.png)

Indexers are the backbone of the protocol. They stake on Subgraphs, index them, and serve queries to anyone consuming Subgraphs.

In the Indexers table, you can see an Indexers’ delegation parameters, their stake, how much they have staked to each Subgraph, and how much revenue they have made from query fees and indexing rewards.

**Specifics**

- Query Fee Cut - the % of the query fee rebates that the Indexer keeps when splitting with Delegators.
- Effective Reward Cut - the indexing reward cut applied to the delegation pool. If it’s negative, it means that the Indexer is giving away part of their rewards. If it’s positive, it means that the Indexer is keeping some of their rewards.
- Cooldown Remaining - the time remaining until the Indexer can change the above delegation parameters. Cooldown periods are set up by Indexers when they update their delegation parameters.
- Owned - This is the Indexer’s deposited stake, which may be slashed for malicious or incorrect behavior.
- Delegated - Stake from Delegators which can be allocated by the Indexer, but cannot be slashed.
- Allocated - Stake that Indexers are actively allocating towards the Subgraphs they are indexing.
- Available Delegation Capacity - the amount of delegated stake the Indexers can still receive before they become over-delegated.
- कमाल डेलिगेशन क्षमता - इंडेक्सर उत्पादकपणे स्वीकारू शकणारी जास्तीत जास्त डेलिगेटेड स्टेक. वाटप किंवा बक्षिसे गणनेसाठी जास्तीचा वाटप केला जाऊ शकत नाही.
- Query Fees - this is the total fees that end users have paid for queries from an Indexer over all time.
- इंडेक्सर रिवॉर्ड्स - हे इंडेक्सर आणि त्यांच्या प्रतिनिधींनी सर्वकाळात मिळवलेले एकूण इंडेक्सर रिवॉर्ड्स आहेत. इंडेक्सर रिवॉर्ड्स GRT जारी करून दिले जातात.

Indexers can earn both query fees and indexing rewards. Functionally, this happens when network participants delegate GRT to an Indexer. This enables Indexers to receive query fees and rewards depending on their Indexer parameters.

- Indexing parameters can be set by clicking on the right-hand side of the table or by going into an Indexer’s profile and clicking the “Delegate” button.

To learn more about how to become an Indexer, you can take a look at the [official documentation](/indexing/overview/) or [The Graph Academy Indexer guides.](https://thegraph.academy/delegators/choosing-indexers/)

![Indexing details pane](/img/Indexing-Details-Pane.png)

#### 2. Curators

Curators analyze Subgraphs to identify which Subgraphs are of the highest quality. Once a Curator has found a potentially high-quality Subgraph, they can curate it by signaling on its bonding curve. In doing so, Curators let Indexers know which Subgraphs are high quality and should be indexed.

- Curators can be community members, data consumers, or even Subgraph developers who signal on their own Subgraphs by depositing GRT tokens into a bonding curve.
  - By depositing GRT, Curators mint curation shares of a Subgraph. As a result, they can earn a portion of the query fees generated by the Subgraph they have signaled on.
  - The bonding curve incentivizes Curators to curate the highest quality data sources.

In the The Curator table listed below you can see:

- The date the Curator started curating
- The number of GRT that was deposited
- The number of shares a Curator owns

![Explorer Image 6](/img/Curation-Overview.png)

If you want to learn more about the Curator role, you can do so by visiting [official documentation.](/resources/roles/curating/) or [The Graph Academy](https://thegraph.academy/curators/).

#### 3. Delegators

Delegators play a key role in maintaining the security and decentralization of The Graph Network. They participate in the network by delegating (i.e., “staking”) GRT tokens to one or multiple indexers.

- Without Delegators, Indexers are less likely to earn significant rewards and fees. Therefore, Indexers attract Delegators by offering them a portion of their indexing rewards and query fees.
- Delegators select Indexers based on a number of different variables, such as past performance, indexing reward rates, and query fee cuts.
- Reputation within the community can also play a factor in the selection process. It's recommended to connect with the selected Indexers via [The Graph's Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol) or [The Graph Forum](https://forum.thegraph.com/).

![Explorer Image 7](/img/Delegation-Overview.png)

In the Delegators table you can see the active Delegators in the community and important metrics:

- The number of Indexers a Delegator is delegating towards
- A Delegator's original delegation
- The rewards they have accumulated but have not withdrawn from the protocol
- The realized rewards they withdrew from the protocol
- Total amount of GRT they have currently in the protocol
- The date they last delegated

If you want to learn more about how to become a Delegator, check out the [official documentation](/resources/roles/delegating/delegating/) or [The Graph Academy](https://docs.thegraph.academy/official-docs/delegator/choosing-indexers).

### Network Page

On this page, you can see global KPIs and have the ability to switch to a per-epoch basis and analyze network metrics in more detail. These details will give you a sense of how the network is performing over time.

#### सविश्लेषण

The overview section has both all the current network metrics and some cumulative metrics over time:

- The current total network stake
- The stake split between the Indexers and their Delegators
- Total supply, minted, and burned GRT since the network inception
- Total Indexing rewards since the inception of the protocol
- Protocol parameters such as curation reward, inflation rate, and more
- Current epoch rewards and fees

A few key details to note:

- **Query fees represent the fees generated by the consumers**. They can be claimed (or not) by the Indexers after a period of at least 7 epochs (see below) after their allocations towards the Subgraphs have been closed and the data they served has been validated by the consumers.
- **Indexing rewards represent the amount of rewards the Indexers claimed from the network issuance during the epoch.** Although the protocol issuance is fixed, the rewards only get minted once Indexers close their allocations towards the Subgraphs they’ve been indexing. So, the per-epoch number of rewards varies (ie. during some epochs, Indexers might’ve collectively closed allocations that have been open for many days).

![Explorer Image 8](/img/Network-Stats.png)

#### Epochs

In the Epochs section, you can analyze on a per-epoch basis, metrics such as:

- Epoch start or end block
- Query fees generated and indexing rewards collected during a specific epoch
- Epoch status, which refers to the query fee collection and distribution and can have different states:
  - सक्रिय युग असा आहे ज्यामध्ये इंडेक्सर्स सध्या स्टेक वाटप करत आहेत आणि क्वेरी फी गोळा करत आहेत
  - सेटलिंग युग हे असे आहेत ज्यामध्ये राज्य वाहिन्या सेटल होत आहेत. याचा अर्थ असा की जर ग्राहकांनी त्यांच्या विरुद्ध विवाद उघडले तर निर्देशांक कमी केले जातील.
  - वितरण युग हे असे युग आहेत ज्यामध्ये युगांसाठी राज्य चॅनेल सेटल केले जात आहेत आणि इंडेक्सर्स त्यांच्या क्वेरी फी सवलतीचा दावा करू शकतात.
  - The finalized epochs are the epochs that have no query fee rebates left to claim by the Indexers.

## Your User Profile

Your personal profile is the place where you can see your network activity, regardless of your role on the network. Your crypto wallet will act as your user profile, and with the User Dashboard, you’ll be able to see the following tabs:

### Profile Overview

In this section, you can view the following:

- Any of your current actions you've done.
- Your profile information, description, and website (if you added one).

![Explorer Image 10](/img/Profile-Overview.png)

### Subgraphs Tab

In the Subgraphs tab, you’ll see your published Subgraphs.

> This will not include any Subgraphs deployed with the CLI for testing purposes. Subgraphs will only show up when they are published to the decentralized network.

![Explorer Image 11](/img/Subgraphs-Overview.png)

### Indexing Tab

In the Indexing tab, you’ll find a table with all the active and historical allocations towards Subgraphs. You will also find charts where you can see and analyze your past performance as an Indexer.

या विभागात तुमच्या निव्वळ इंडेक्सर रिवॉर्ड्स आणि नेट क्वेरी फीबद्दल तपशील देखील समाविष्ट असतील. तुम्हाला खालील मेट्रिक्स दिसतील:

- Delegated Stake - the stake from Delegators that can be allocated by you but cannot be slashed
- एकूण क्वेरी शुल्क - वापरकर्त्यांनी वेळोवेळी तुमच्याद्वारे दिलेल्या क्वेरींसाठी भरलेले एकूण शुल्क
- Indexer Rewards - the total amount of Indexer rewards you have received, in GRT
- फी कट - तुम्ही डेलिगेटर्ससह विभक्त झाल्यावर तुम्ही ठेवू शकणार्‍या क्वेरी फी सवलतींचा %
- Rewards Cut - the % of Indexer rewards that you will keep when splitting with Delegators
- मालकीचा - तुमचा जमा केलेला हिस्सा, जो दुर्भावनापूर्ण किंवा चुकीच्या वर्तनासाठी कमी केला जाऊ शकतो

![Explorer Image 12](/img/Indexer-Stats.png)

### Delegating Tab

Delegators are important to the Graph Network. They must use their knowledge to choose an Indexer that will provide a healthy return on rewards.

In the Delegators tab, you can find the details of your active and historical delegations, along with the metrics of the Indexers that you delegated towards.

पृष्‍ठाच्या पूर्वार्धात, तुम्‍ही तुमच्‍या डेलिगेशन चार्ट तसेच रिवॉर्ड-ओन्ली चार्ट पाहू शकता. डावीकडे, तुम्ही KPI पाहू शकता जे तुमचे वर्तमान प्रतिनिधीत्व मेट्रिक्स दर्शवतात.

या टॅबमध्ये तुम्हाला येथे दिसणार्‍या डेलिगेटर मेट्रिक्समध्ये हे समाविष्ट आहे:

- एकूण प्रतिनिधीत्व बक्षिसे
- Total unrealized rewards
- Total realized rewards

पृष्ठाच्या दुसऱ्या सहामाहीत, आपल्याकडे प्रतिनिधी टेबल आहे. येथे तुम्ही ज्या निर्देशांकांना तुम्ही नियुक्त केले आहे, तसेच त्यांचे तपशील (जसे की रिवॉर्ड कट, कूलडाउन इ.) पाहू शकता.

टेबलच्या उजव्या बाजूला असलेल्या बटणांच्या सहाय्याने, तुम्ही तुमचे प्रतिनिधीमंडळ व्यवस्थापित करू शकता - वितळण्याच्या कालावधीनंतर तुमचे प्रतिनिधीमंडळ अधिक प्रतिनिधी, अस्वीकृत किंवा मागे घेऊ शकता.

लक्षात ठेवा की हा चार्ट क्षैतिजरित्या स्क्रोल करण्यायोग्य आहे, म्हणून तुम्ही उजवीकडे स्क्रोल केल्यास, तुम्ही तुमच्या प्रतिनिधीची स्थिती देखील पाहू शकता (प्रतिनिधी, अस्वीकृत, मागे घेण्यायोग्य).

![Explorer Image 13](/img/Delegation-Stats.png)

### Curating Tab

In the Curation tab, you’ll find all the Subgraphs you’re signaling on (thus enabling you to receive query fees). Signaling allows Curators to highlight to Indexers which Subgraphs are valuable and trustworthy, thus signaling that they need to be indexed on.

या टॅबमध्ये, तुम्हाला याचे विहंगावलोकन मिळेल:

- All the Subgraphs you're curating on with signal details
- Share totals per Subgraph
- Query rewards per Subgraph
- Updated at date details

![Explorer Image 14](/img/Curation-Stats.png)

### Your Profile Settings

तुमच्या वापरकर्ता प्रोफाइलमध्ये, तुम्ही तुमचे वैयक्तिक प्रोफाइल तपशील व्यवस्थापित करण्यास सक्षम असाल (जसे की ENS नाव सेट करणे). तुम्ही इंडेक्सर असल्यास, तुमच्या बोटांच्या टोकावर असलेल्या सेटिंग्जमध्ये तुम्हाला आणखी प्रवेश आहे. तुमच्या वापरकर्ता प्रोफाइलमध्ये, तुम्ही तुमचे डेलिगेशन पॅरामीटर्स आणि ऑपरेटर सेट करू शकाल.

- ऑपरेटर इंडेक्सरच्या वतीने प्रोटोकॉलमध्ये मर्यादित कृती करतात, जसे की वाटप उघडणे आणि बंद करणे. ऑपरेटर हे सामान्यत: इतर इथरियम पत्ते असतात, जे त्यांच्या स्टॅकिंग वॉलेटपासून वेगळे असतात, इंडेक्सर्स वैयक्तिकरित्या सेट करू शकणार्‍या नेटवर्कवर गेट केलेला प्रवेश असतो
- Delegation parameters allow you to control the distribution of GRT between you and your Delegators.

![Explorer Image 15](/img/Profile-Settings.png)

As your official portal into the world of decentralized data, Graph Explorer allows you to take a variety of actions, no matter your role in the network. You can get to your profile settings by opening the dropdown menu next to your address, then clicking on the Settings button.
