## Querying Plans

There are two plans to use when querying Subgraphs on The Graph Network.

- **Free Plan**: The Free Plan includes 100,000 free monthly queries with full access to the Subgraph Studio testing environment. This plan is designed for hobbyists, hackathoners, and those with side projects to try out The Graph before scaling their dapp.

- **Growth Plan**: The Growth Plan includes everything in the Free Plan with all queries after 100,000 monthly queries requiring payments with GRT or credit card. The Growth Plan is flexible enough to cover teams that have established dapps across a variety of use cases.

## Query Payments with credit card

- To set up billing with credit/debit cards, users should access Subgraph Studio (https://thegraph.com/studio/)
  1. Go to the [Subgraph Studio Billing page](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraphs/billing/).
  2. पृष्ठाच्या वरच्या उजव्या कोपर्यात "कनेक्ट वॉलेट" बटणावर क्लिक करा. तुम्हाला वॉलेट निवड पृष्ठावर पुनर्निर्देशित केले जाईल. तुमचे वॉलेट निवडा आणि "कनेक्ट" वर क्लिक करा.
  3. Choose “Upgrade plan” if you are upgrading from the Free Plan or choose “Manage Plan” if you have already added GRT to your billing balance in the past. Next, you can estimate the number of queries to get a pricing estimate, but this is not a required step.
  4. To choose a credit card payment, choose “Credit card” as the payment method and fill out your credit card information. Those who have used Stripe before can use the Link feature to autofill their details.
- Invoices will be processed at the end of each month and require an active credit card on file for all queries beyond the free plan quota.

## Query Payments with GRT

Subgraph users can use The Graph Token (or GRT) to pay for queries on The Graph Network. With GRT, invoices will be processed at the end of each month and require a sufficient balance of GRT to make queries beyond the Free Plan quota of 100,000 monthly queries. You'll be required to pay fees generated from your API keys. Using the billing contract, you'll be able to:

- Add and withdraw GRT from your account balance.
- तुम्ही तुमच्या खात्यातील शिल्लकमध्ये किती GRT जोडले आहे, तुम्ही किती काढले आहे आणि तुमच्या इनव्हॉइसवर आधारित तुमच्या शिल्लकांचा मागोवा ठेवा.
- जोपर्यंत तुमच्या खात्यातील शिल्लक पुरेशी GRT आहे तोपर्यंत व्युत्पन्न केलेल्या क्वेरी शुल्कावर आधारित चलन स्वयंचलितपणे भरा.

### GRT on Arbitrum or Ethereum

The Graph’s billing system accepts GRT on Arbitrum, and users will need ETH on Arbitrum to pay their gas. While The Graph protocol started on Ethereum Mainnet, all activity, including the billing contracts, is now on Arbitrum One.

To pay for queries, you need GRT on Arbitrum. Here are a few different ways to achieve this:

- If you already have GRT on Ethereum, you can bridge it to Arbitrum. You can do this via the GRT bridging option provided in Subgraph Studio or by using one of the following bridges:

- [The Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)

- [TransferTo](https://transferto.xyz/swap)

- If you already have assets on Arbitrum, you can swap them for GRT via a swapping protocol like Uniswap.

- Alternatively, you acquire GRT directly on Arbitrum through a decentralized exchange.

> This section is written assuming you already have GRT in your wallet, and you're on Arbitrum. If you don't have GRT, you can learn how to get GRT [here](#getting-grt).

Once you bridge GRT, you can add it to your billing balance.

### Adding GRT using a wallet

1. Go to the [Subgraph Studio Billing page](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraphs/billing/).
2. पृष्ठाच्या वरच्या उजव्या कोपर्यात "कनेक्ट वॉलेट" बटणावर क्लिक करा. तुम्हाला वॉलेट निवड पृष्ठावर पुनर्निर्देशित केले जाईल. तुमचे वॉलेट निवडा आणि "कनेक्ट" वर क्लिक करा.
3. Select the "Manage" button near the top right corner. First time users will see an option to "Upgrade to Growth plan" while returning users will click "Deposit from wallet".
4. Use the slider to estimate the number of queries you expect to make on a monthly basis.
   - For suggestions on the number of queries you may use, see our **Frequently Asked Questions** page.
5. Choose "Cryptocurrency". GRT is currently the only cryptocurrency accepted on The Graph Network.
6. Select the number of months you would like to prepay.
   - Paying in advance does not commit you to future usage. You will only be charged for what you use and you can withdraw your balance at any time.
7. Pick the network from which you are depositing your GRT. GRT on Arbitrum or Ethereum are both acceptable.
8. Click "Allow GRT Access" and then specify the amount of GRT that can be taken from you wallet.
   - If you are prepaying for multiple months, you must allow access to the amount that corresponds with that amount. This interaction will not cost any gas.
9. Lastly, click on "Add GRT to Billing Balance". This transaction will require ETH on Arbitrum to cover the gas costs.

- Note that GRT deposited from Arbitrum will process within a few moments while GRT deposited from Ethereum will take approximately 15-20 minutes to process. Once the transaction is confirmed, you'll see the GRT added to your account balance.

## Billing FAQs

### How many queries will I need?

You don't need to know how many queries you'll need in advance. You will only be charged for what you use and you can withdraw GRT from your account at any time.

We recommend you overestimate the number of queries you will need so that you don’t have to top up your balance frequently. A good estimate for small to medium sized applications is to start with 1M-2M queries per month and monitor usage closely in the first weeks. For larger apps, a good estimate is to use the number of daily visits your site gets multiplied by the number of queries your most active page makes upon opening.

Of course, both new and existing users can reach out to Edge & Node's BD team for a consult to learn more about anticipated usage.

### Can I withdraw GRT from my billing balance?

Yes, you can always withdraw GRT that has not already been used for queries from your billing balance. The billing contract is only designed to bridge GRT from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum network. If you'd like to transfer your GRT from Arbitrum back to Ethereum mainnet, you'll need to use the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161).

### What happens when my billing balance runs out? Will I get a warning?

You will receive several email notifications before your billing balance runs out.
