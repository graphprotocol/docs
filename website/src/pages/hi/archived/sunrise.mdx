> नोट: Decentralized Data का Sunrise 12 जून, 2024 को समाप्त हो गया।

## विकेंद्रीकृत डेटा का सूर्योदय क्या था?

The Sunrise of Decentralized Data was an initiative spearheaded by Edge & Node. This initiative enabled Subgraph developers to upgrade to The Graph’s decentralized network seamlessly.

This plan drew on previous developments from The Graph ecosystem, including an upgrade Indexer to serve queries on newly published Subgraphs.

### Hosted service का क्या होगा?

The hosted service query endpoints are no longer available, and developers cannot deploy new Subgraphs on the hosted service.

During the upgrade process, owners of hosted service Subgraphs could upgrade their Subgraphs to The Graph Network. Additionally, developers were able to claim auto-upgraded Subgraphs.

### क्या इस अपग्रेड से Subgraph Studio प्रभावित हुआ था?

नहीं, सबग्राफ स्टूडियो पर Sunrise का कोई प्रभाव नहीं पड़ा। सबग्राफ तुरंत क्वेरी के लिए उपलब्ध थे, जो अपग्रेड किए गए Indexer द्वारा संचालित हैं, जो उसी इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर का उपयोग करता है जैसा Hosted Service में होता है।

### Why were Subgraphs published to Arbitrum, did it start indexing a different network?

The Graph Network was initially deployed on Ethereum mainnet but was later moved to Arbitrum One in order to lower gas costs for all users. As a result, all new Subgraphs are published to The Graph Network on Arbitrum so that Indexers can support them. Arbitrum is the network that Subgraphs are published to, but Subgraphs can index any of the [supported networks](/supported-networks/)

## About the Upgrade Indexer

> अपग्रेड Indexer वर्तमान में सक्रिय है।

The upgrade Indexer was implemented to improve the experience of upgrading Subgraphs from the hosted service to The Graph Network and support new versions of existing Subgraphs that had not yet been indexed.

### अपग्रेड Indexer क्या करता है?

- It bootstraps chains that have yet to receive indexing rewards on The Graph Network and ensures that an Indexer is available to serve queries as quickly as possible after a Subgraph is published.
- यह उन chain को भी सपोर्ट करता है जो पहले केवल Hosted Service पर उपलब्ध थीं। सपोर्टेड chain की व्यापक सूची [यहां](/supported-networks/) देखें।
- Indexers that operate an upgrade Indexer do so as a public service to support new Subgraphs and additional chains that lack indexing rewards before The Graph Council approves them.

### Why is Edge & Node running the upgrade Indexer?

Edge & Node historically maintained the hosted service and, as a result, already have synced data for hosted service Subgraphs.

### What does the upgrade indexer mean for existing Indexers?

पहले केवल होस्टेड सेवा पर समर्थित चेन अब बिना indexing पुरस्कार के डेवलपर्स के लिएT he Graph Network पर उपलब्ध कराई गईं।

However, this action unlocked query fees for any interested Indexer and increased the number of Subgraphs published on The Graph Network. As a result, Indexers have more opportunities to index and serve these Subgraphs in exchange for query fees, even before indexing rewards are enabled for a chain.

The upgrade Indexer also provides the Indexer community with information about the potential demand for Subgraphs and new chains on The Graph Network.

### What does this mean for Delegators?

The upgrade Indexer offers a powerful opportunity for Delegators. As it allowed more Subgraphs to be upgraded from the hosted service to The Graph Network, Delegators benefit from the increased network activity.

### क्या अपग्रेड किया गया Indexer मौजूदा Indexer के साथ पुरस्कारों के लिए प्रतिस्पर्धा करता था?

No, the upgrade Indexer only allocates the minimum amount per Subgraph and does not collect indexing rewards.

It operates on an “as needed” basis, serving as a fallback until sufficient service quality is achieved by at least three other Indexers in the network for respective chains and Subgraphs.

### How does this affect Subgraph developers?

Subgraph developers can query their Subgraphs on The Graph Network almost immediately after upgrading from the hosted service or [publishing from Subgraph Studio](/subgraphs/developing/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/), as no lead time was required for indexing. Please note that [creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/) was not impacted by this upgrade.

### अपग्रेड Indexer डेटा उपभोक्ताओं को कैसे लाभ पहुंचाता है?

The upgrade Indexer enables chains on the network that were previously only supported on the hosted service. Therefore, it widens the scope and availability of data that can be queried on the network.

### अपग्रेड Indexer क्वेरीज़ की कीमत कैसे तय करता है?

अपग्रेड में Indexer बाज़ार दर पर क्वेरीज़ की कीमत तय करता है ताकि क्वेरी शुल्क बाज़ार पर कोई प्रभाव न पड़े।

### When will the upgrade Indexer stop supporting a Subgraph?

The upgrade Indexer supports a Subgraph until at least 3 other Indexers successfully and consistently serve queries made to it.

Furthermore, the upgrade Indexer stops supporting a Subgraph if it has not been queried in the last 30 days.

Other Indexers are incentivized to support Subgraphs with ongoing query volume. The query volume to the upgrade Indexer should trend towards zero, as it has a small allocation size, and other Indexers should be chosen for queries ahead of it.
