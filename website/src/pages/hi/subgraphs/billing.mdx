## Querying Plans

There are two plans to use when querying Subgraphs on The Graph Network.

- **Free Plan**: The Free Plan includes 100,000 free monthly queries with full access to the Subgraph Studio testing environment. This plan is designed for hobbyists, hackathoners, and those with side projects to try out The Graph before scaling their dapp.

- **Growth Plan**: The Growth Plan includes everything in the Free Plan with all queries after 100,000 monthly queries requiring payments with GRT or credit card. The Growth Plan is flexible enough to cover teams that have established dapps across a variety of use cases.

## Query Payments with credit card

- क्रेडिट/डेबिट कार्ड के साथ बिलिंग सेट करने के लिए, उपयोगकर्ताओं को **Subgraph Studio** (https://thegraph.com/studio/) पर जाना चाहिए।
  1. Go to the [Subgraph Studio Billing page](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraphs/billing/).
  2. पृष्ठ के ऊपरी दाएं कोने पर "कनेक्ट वॉलेट" बटन पर क्लिक करें। आपको बटुआ चयन पृष्ठ पर पुनर्निर्देशित किया जाएगा। अपना बटुआ चुनें और "कनेक्ट" पर क्लिक करें।
  3. Choose “Upgrade plan” if you are upgrading from the Free Plan or choose “Manage Plan” if you have already added GRT to your billing balance in the past. Next, you can estimate the number of queries to get a pricing estimate, but this is not a required step.
  4. To choose a credit card payment, choose “Credit card” as the payment method and fill out your credit card information. Those who have used Stripe before can use the Link feature to autofill their details.
- Invoices will be processed at the end of each month and require an active credit card on file for all queries beyond the free plan quota.

## Query Payments with GRT

Subgraph users can use The Graph Token (or GRT) to pay for queries on The Graph Network. With GRT, invoices will be processed at the end of each month and require a sufficient balance of GRT to make queries beyond the Free Plan quota of 100,000 monthly queries. You'll be required to pay fees generated from your API keys. Using the billing contract, you'll be able to:

- अपने खाते की शेष राशि से जीआरटी जोड़ें और निकालें।
- आपने अपने खाते की शेष राशि में कितना GRT जोड़ा है, आपने कितना निकाला है, और अपने चालानों के आधार पर अपनी शेष राशि का ट्रैक रखें।
- जब तक आपके खाते की शेष राशि में पर्याप्त GRT है, उत्पन्न क्वेरी शुल्क के आधार पर स्वचालित रूप से चालान का भुगतान करें।

### GRT on Arbitrum or Ethereum

The Graph का बिलिंग सिस्टम Arbitrum पर GRT को स्वीकार करता है, और उपयोगकर्ताओं को गैस के भुगतान के लिए Arbitrum  पर ETH की आवश्यकता होगी। जबकि The Graph प्रोटोकॉल Ethereum Mainnet पर शुरू हुआ, सभी गतिविधियाँ, जिसमें बिलिंग कॉन्ट्रैक्ट्स भी शामिल हैं, अब Arbitrum One पर हैं।

क्वेरियों के लिए भुगतान करने के लिए, आपको Arbitrum पर GRT की आवश्यकता है। इसे प्राप्त करने के लिए कुछ विभिन्न तरीके यहां दिए गए हैं:

- यदि आपके पास पहले से  Ethereum पर GRT है, तो आप इसे Arbitrum पर ब्रिज कर सकते हैं। आप यह Subgraph Studio में प्रदान किए गए GRT ब्रिजिंग विकल्प के माध्यम से या निम्नलिखित में से किसी एक ब्रिज का उपयोग करके कर सकते हैं:

- [The Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)

- [TransferTo](https://transferto.xyz/swap)

- यदि आपके पास पहले से Arbitrum पर संपत्तियाँ हैं, तो आप उन्हें Uniswap जैसे स्वैपिंग प्रोटोकॉल के माध्यम से GRT के लिए स्वैप कर सकते हैं।

- वैकल्पिक रूप से, आप एक विकेंद्रीकृत एक्सचेंज के माध्यम से Arbitrum पर सीधे GRT प्राप्त कर सकते हैं।

> This section is written assuming you already have GRT in your wallet, and you're on Arbitrum. If you don't have GRT, you can learn how to get GRT [here](#getting-grt).

एक बार जब आप GRT को ब्रिज करते हैं, तो आप इसे अपने बिलिंग बैलेंस में जोड़ सकते हैं।

### Adding GRT using a wallet

1. Go to the [Subgraph Studio Billing page](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraphs/billing/).
2. पृष्ठ के ऊपरी दाएं कोने पर "कनेक्ट वॉलेट" बटन पर क्लिक करें। आपको बटुआ चयन पृष्ठ पर पुनर्निर्देशित किया जाएगा। अपना बटुआ चुनें और "कनेक्ट" पर क्लिक करें।

5. Choose "Cryptocurrency". GRT is currently the only cryptocurrency accepted on The Graph Network.
6. Select the number of months you would like to prepay.
   - Paying in advance does not commit you to future usage. You will only be charged for what you use and you can withdraw your balance at any time.
7. Pick the network from which you are depositing your GRT. GRT on Arbitrum or Ethereum are both acceptable.
8. Click "Allow GRT Access" and then specify the amount of GRT that can be taken from you wallet.
   - If you are prepaying for multiple months, you must allow access to the amount that corresponds with that amount. This interaction will not cost any gas.
9. Lastly, click on "Add GRT to Billing Balance". This transaction will require ETH on Arbitrum to cover the gas costs.

- Note that GRT deposited from Arbitrum will process within a few moments while GRT deposited from Ethereum will take approximately 15-20 minutes to process. Once the transaction is confirmed, you'll see the GRT added to your account balance.

## Billing FAQs

### How many queries will I need?

आपको यह पहले से नहीं जानना होगा कि आपको कितनी क्वेरीज़ की आवश्यकता होगी। आपको केवल उसी के लिए चार्ज किया जाएगा जो आप उपयोग करते हैं, और आप कभी भी अपने खाते से GRT निकाल सकते हैं।

We recommend you overestimate the number of queries you will need so that you don’t have to top up your balance frequently. A good estimate for small to medium sized applications is to start with 1M-2M queries per month and monitor usage closely in the first weeks. For larger apps, a good estimate is to use the number of daily visits your site gets multiplied by the number of queries your most active page makes upon opening.

Of course, both new and existing users can reach out to Edge & Node's BD team for a consult to learn more about anticipated usage.

### Can I withdraw GRT from my billing balance?

Yes, you can always withdraw GRT that has not already been used for queries from your billing balance. The billing contract is only designed to bridge GRT from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum network. If you'd like to transfer your GRT from Arbitrum back to Ethereum mainnet, you'll need to use the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161).

### जब मेरा बिलिंग बैलेंस खत्म हो जाता है, तो क्या होगा? क्या मुझे कोई चेतावनी मिलेगी?

You will receive several email notifications before your billing balance runs out.
