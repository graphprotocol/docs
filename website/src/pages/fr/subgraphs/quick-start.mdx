Learn how to easily build, publish and query a [Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/developer-faq/#1-what-is-a-subgraph) on The Graph.

## Prérequis

- Un portefeuille crypto
- Une adresse de contrat intelligent sur un [réseau pris en charge](/supported-networks/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installé
- Un gestionnaire de package de votre choix (`npm`, `yarn` ou `pnpm`)

## Comment construire un subgraph

### 1. Create a Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

Accédez à [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) et connectez votre portefeuille.

Subgraph Studio lets you create, manage, deploy, and publish Subgraphs, as well as create and manage API keys.

Click "Create a Subgraph". It is recommended to name the Subgraph in Title Case: "Subgraph Name Chain Name".

### 2. Installez la CLI Graph

Sur votre machine locale, exécutez l'une des commandes suivantes :

Utilisation de [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) :

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli@latest
```

Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### 3. Initialize your Subgraph

> You can find commands for your specific Subgraph on the Subgraph page in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

The `graph init` command will automatically create a scaffold of a Subgraph based on your contract's events.

The following command initializes your Subgraph from an existing contract:

```sh
graph init
```

Si votre contrat est vérifié sur le scanner de blocs où il est déployé (comme [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)), l'ABI sera automatiquement créé dans le CLI.

When you initialize your Subgraph, the CLI will ask you for the following information:

- **Protocol**: Choose the protocol your Subgraph will be indexing data from.
- **Subgraph slug**: Create a name for your Subgraph. Your Subgraph slug is an identifier for your Subgraph.
- **Directory**: Choose a directory to create your Subgraph in.
- **Ethereum network** (optional): You may need to specify which EVM-compatible network your Subgraph will be indexing data from.
- **Adresse du contrat** : Localisez l'adresse du contrat intelligent dont vous souhaitez interroger les données.
- **ABI** : Si l'ABI n'est pas renseigné automatiquement, vous devrez le saisir manuellement sous la forme d'un fichier JSON.
- **Start Block**: You should input the start block to optimize Subgraph indexing of blockchain data. Locate the start block by finding the block where your contract was deployed.
- **Nom du contrat** : Saisissez le nom de votre contrat.
- **Index contract events as entities**: It is suggested that you set this to true, as it will automatically add mappings to your Subgraph for every emitted event.
- **Ajouter un autre contrat** (facultatif) : Vous pouvez ajouter un autre contrat.

See the following screenshot for an example for what to expect when initializing your Subgraph:

### 4. Edit your Subgraph

The `init` command in the previous step creates a scaffold Subgraph that you can use as a starting point to build your Subgraph.

When making changes to the Subgraph, you will mainly work with three files:

- Manifest (`subgraph.yaml`) - defines what data sources your Subgraph will index.
- Schema (`schema.graphql`) - defines what data you wish to retrieve from the Subgraph.
- AssemblyScript Mappings (`mapping.ts`) - translates data from your data sources to the entities defined in the schema.

For a detailed breakdown on how to write your Subgraph, check out [Creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/).

### 5. Deploy your Subgraph

> N'oubliez pas que le déploiement n'est pas la même chose que la publication.

When you **deploy** a Subgraph, you push it to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/), where you can test, stage and review it. A deployed Subgraph's indexing is performed by the [Upgrade Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/upgrade-indexer/), which is a single Indexer owned and operated by Edge & Node, rather than by the many decentralized Indexers in The Graph Network. A **deployed** Subgraph is free to use, rate-limited, not visible to the public, and meant to be used for development, staging, and testing purposes.

Once your Subgraph is written, run the following commands:

````
```sh
graph codegen && graph build
```
````

Authenticate and deploy your Subgraph. The deploy key can be found on the Subgraph's page in Subgraph Studio.

![Clé de déploiement](/img/subgraph-studio-deploy-key.jpg)

````
```sh

graph auth <DEPLOY_KEY>

graph deploy <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```
````

La CLI demandera un label de version. Il est fortement recommandé d'utiliser [le versionnement sémantique](https://semver.org/), par exemple `0.0.1`.

### 6. Review your Subgraph

If you’d like to test your Subgraph before publishing it, you can use [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to do the following:

- Exécuter un exemple de requête.
- Analyze your Subgraph in the dashboard to check information.
- Check the logs on the dashboard to see if there are any errors with your Subgraph. The logs of an operational Subgraph will look like this:

  ![Logs du subgraph](/img/subgraph-logs-image.png)

### 7. Publish your Subgraph to The Graph Network

When your Subgraph is ready for a production environment, you can publish it to the decentralized network. Publishing is an onchain action that does the following:

- It makes your Subgraph available to be to indexed by the decentralized [Indexers](/indexing/overview/) on The Graph Network.
- It removes rate limits and makes your Subgraph publicly searchable and queryable in [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/).
- It makes your Subgraph available for [Curators](/resources/roles/curating/) to curate it.

> The greater the amount of GRT you and others curate on your Subgraph, the more Indexers will be incentivized to index your Subgraph, improving the quality of service, reducing latency, and enhancing network redundancy for your Subgraph.

#### Publier avec Subgraph Studio⁠

To publish your Subgraph, click the Publish button in the dashboard.

![Publish a Subgraph on Subgraph Studio](/img/publish-sub-transfer.png)

Select the network to which you would like to publish your Subgraph.

#### Publication à partir de la CLI

As of version 0.73.0, you can also publish your Subgraph with the Graph CLI.

Ouvrez le `graph-cli`.

Utilisez les commandes suivantes :

````
```sh
graph codegen && graph build
```

Then,

```sh
graph publish
```
````

3. A window will open, allowing you to connect your wallet, add metadata, and deploy your finalized Subgraph to a network of your choice.

![cli-ui](/img/cli-ui.png)

Pour personnaliser votre déploiement, voir [Publier un subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/).

#### Adding signal to your Subgraph

1. To attract Indexers to query your Subgraph, you should add GRT curation signal to it.

   - This action improves quality of service, reduces latency, and enhances network redundancy and availability for your Subgraph.

2. Si éligibles aux récompenses d'indexation, les Indexeurs reçoivent des récompenses en GRT proportionnelles au montant signalé.

   - It’s recommended to curate at least 3,000 GRT to attract 3 Indexers. Check reward eligibility based on Subgraph feature usage and supported networks.

Pour en savoir plus sur la curation, lisez [Curating](/resources/roles/curating/).

To save on gas costs, you can curate your Subgraph in the same transaction you publish it by selecting this option:

### 8. Query your Subgraph

You now have access to 100,000 free queries per month with your Subgraph on The Graph Network!

You can query your Subgraph by sending GraphQL queries to its Query URL, which you can find by clicking the Query button.

For more information about querying data from your Subgraph, read [Querying The Graph](/subgraphs/querying/introduction/).
