## Aperçu

```yaml
'On Uniswap, return the top-10 pools by total value locked in USD.'
```

### Behind the Scenes

The Assistant:

1. Interprets your intent
2. Maps it to the correct Subgraphs or Token API endpoint
3. Executes optimized queries
4. Returns clean, structured results

You don't need to write queries or understand a Subgraph's schema, you simply ask.

### Example Use Cases

**Protocol Analytics**

- “Compare daily active users on Aave vs. Compound in May 2025.”
- “Show me the total value locked (TVL) for XYZDAO over the last quarter.”

**Token Insights**

- “What are the top 10 tokens by market cap on Ethereum Mainnet right now?”
- “How many XYZ did I receive between May 1 and May 15?”

**Historical Data Retrieval**

- “Fetch the token price history of XYZ for the last six months.”
- “What was the average gas price on Ethereum Mainnet during April?”

**Portfolio Monitoring**

- “List my wallet’s current token balances and their USD equivalents.”
- “Calculate profit/loss on XYZ since xyz date.”

**Cross-Chain Comparison**

- “Show me the 7-day trading volume of XYZ on Ethereum Mainnet vs. Polygon Mainnet.”
