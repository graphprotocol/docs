To start querying right away, visit [The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer).

## Overview

When a Subgraph is published to The Graph Network, you can visit its Subgraph details page on Graph Explorer and use the "Query" tab to explore the deployed GraphQL API for each Subgraph.

## Specifics

Each Subgraph published to The Graph Network has a unique query URL in Graph Explorer to make direct queries. You can find it by navigating to the Subgraph details page and clicking on the "Query" button in the top right corner.

You will notice that this query URL must use a unique API key. You can create and manage your API keys in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio), under the "API Keys" section. Learn more about how to use Subgraph Studio [here](/deploying/subgraph-studio/).

Subgraph Studio users start on a Free Plan, which allows them to make 100,000 queries per month. Additional queries are available on the Growth Plan, which offers usage based pricing for additional queries, payable by credit card, or GRT on Arbitrum. You can learn more about billing [here](/subgraphs/billing/).

> Please see the [Query API](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/) for a complete reference on how to query the Subgraph's entities.
>
> Note: If you encounter 405 errors with a GET request to the Graph Explorer URL, please switch to a POST request instead.
