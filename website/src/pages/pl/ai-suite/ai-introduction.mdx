title: The Graph's AI
---

Build with speed and scale faster with The Graph's AI.

## Using AI on The Graph

Instead of relying on static datasets or centralized APIs, you can now use our AI-native tooling, [Subgraph MCP](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/introduction/) and [Token API MCP](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/introduction/).

### Why Use Onchain Data with AI?

Using onchain data with AI unlocks powerful new ways to interact with and understand blockchain ecosystems.

- **AI for Developers**: You can use AI to interact directly with The Graph's data through your agents or build AI-powered applications on top of it. This streamlines development and opens up more intuitive, dynamic use cases.

## AI for Developers

### Enable Natural Language Access to Onchain Data

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) servers connect to Claude, Cline, and Cursor. They enable models to understand, query, and interact with structured onchain data using natural language. MCPs remove the need to write low-level queries or interact with APIs directly.

### Subgraph MCP

The [Subgraph MCP](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/introduction/) server connects models to Subgraphs on The Graph Network. It allows language models to explore Subgraph schemas, execute GraphQL queries, find relevant Subgraphs by keyword or contract, and surface usage metrics using natural language.

### Token API MCP

The [Token API MCP](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/introduction/) MCP server enables models to access onchain token data. It supports querying token metadata, wallet balances, transfer history, and top token holders through simple prompts.

#### Benefits of Using Subgraph and Token API MCPs

- Query Subgraphs and token data using natural language
- Access GraphQL schemas and token metadata without manual queries
- Find Subgraphs by keyword or contract and check 30-day usage
- Retrieve real-time data from The Graph and onchain token sources
- Get wallet balances, transfer history, and top token holders
