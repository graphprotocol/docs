title: Fair Use Policy
---

> Effective Date: May 15, 2025

## Overview

This outlines storage limits for Subgraphs that rely solely on [Edge & Node's Upgrade Indexer](/subgraphs/upgrade-indexer/). This policy is designed to ensure fair and optimized use of queries across the community.

To maintain performance and reliability across its infrastructure, Edge & Node is updating its Upgrade Indexer Subgraph storage policy. Free usage tiers remain available, but users who exceed specified limits will need to upgrade to a paid plan. Storage allocations and thresholds vary by feature.

### 1. Scope

This policy applies to all individual users, teams, chains, and dapps using Edge & Node's Upgrade Indexer in Subgraph Studio for storage and queries.

### 2. Fair Use Storage Limits

**Free Storage: Up to 10 GB**

Beyond that, pricing is variable and adjusts based on usage patterns, network conditions, infrastructure requirements, and specific use-cases.

Reach out to Edge & Node at [info@edgeandnode.com](mailto:info@edgeandnode.com) to discuss options that meet your technical needs.

You can monitor your usage via [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

### 3. Fair Use Limits

To preserve the stability of Edge & Node's Subgraph Studio and preserve the reliability of The Graph Network, the Edge & Node Support Team will monitor storage usage and take corresponding action with Subgraphs that have:

- Abnormally high or sustained bandwidth or storage usage beyond posted limits
- Circumvention of storage thresholds (e.g., use of multiple free-tier accounts)

The Edge & Node Support Team reserves the right to revise storage limits or impose temporary constraints for operational integrity.

If you exceed your included storage:

- Try [pruning Subgraph data](/subgraphs/best-practices/pruning/) to remove unused entities and help stay within storage limits
- [Add signal to the Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph) to encourage other Indexers on the network to serve it
- You will receive multiple notifications and email alerts
- A grace period of 14 days will be provided to upgrade or reduce storage

Edge & Node's team is committed to helping users avoid unnecessary interruptions and will continue to support all web3 builders.

### 4. Subgraph Data Retention

Subgraphs inactive for over 14 days or Subgraphs that exceed free-tier storage limits will be subject to automatic data archival or deletion. Edge & Node's team will notify you before any such actions are taken.

### 5. Support

If you believe your usage is incorrectly flagged or have unique use cases (e.g. approved special request pending new Subgraph upgrade plan), reach out the Edge & Node team at info@edgeandnode.com. 31 changes: 31 additions & 0 deletions31

## title: Subgraph Studio FAQs

## 1. What is Subgraph Studio?

[Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) is a dapp for creating, managing, and publishing Subgraphs and API keys.

## 2. How do I create an API Key?

To create an API, navigate to Subgraph Studio and connect your wallet. You will be able to click the API keys tab at the top. There, you will be able to create an API key.

## 3. Can I create multiple API Keys?

Yes! You can create multiple API Keys to use in different projects. Check out the link [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).

## 4. How do I restrict a domain for an API Key?

After creating an API Key, in the Security section, you can define the domains that can query a specific API Key.

## 5. Can I transfer my Subgraph to another owner?

Yes, Subgraphs that have been published to Arbitrum One can be transferred to a new wallet or a Multisig. You can do so by clicking the three dots next to the 'Publish' button on the Subgraph's details page and selecting 'Transfer ownership'.

Note that you will no longer be able to see or edit the Subgraph in Studio once it has been transferred.

## 6. How do I find query URLs for Subgraphs if I’m not the developer of the Subgraph I want to use?

You can find the query URL of each Subgraph in the Subgraph Details section of Graph Explorer. When you click on the “Query” button, you will be directed to a pane wherein you can view the query URL of the Subgraph you’re interested in. You can then replace the `<api_key>` placeholder with the API key you wish to leverage in Subgraph Studio.

Remember that you can create an API key and query any Subgraph published to the network, even if you build a Subgraph yourself. These queries via the new API key, are paid queries as any other on the network.
