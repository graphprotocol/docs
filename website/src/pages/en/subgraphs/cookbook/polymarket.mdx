Query Polymarket’s onchain data using GraphQL via subgraphs on The Graph Network. Subgraphs are decentralized APIs powered by The Graph, a protocol for indexing & querying data from blockchains.

## Polymarket Subgraph on Graph Explorer

You can see an interactive query playground on the [Polymarket subgraph’s page on The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/Bx1W4S7kDVxs9gC3s2G6DS8kdNBJNVhMviCtin2DiBp?view=Query&chain=arbitrum-one), where you can test any query.

## How to use the Visual Query Editor

The visual query editor helps you test sample queries from your subgraph.

You can use the GraphiQL Explorer to compose your GraphQL queries by clicking on the fields you want.

### Example Query: Get the top 5 highest payouts from Polymarket

```
{
  redemptions(orderBy: payout, orderDirection: desc, first: 5) {
    payout
    redeemer
    id
    timestamp
  }
}
```

### Example output

```

## How to Query with the API

You can pass any GraphQL query to the Polymarket endpoint and receive data in json format.

This following code example will return the exact same output as above.

### Sample Code from node.js

```
const axios = require('axios');

const graphqlQuery = `{
  positions(first: 5) {
    condition
    outcomeIndex
  }
};

const queryUrl = 'https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/{api-key}/subgraphs/id/Bx1W4S7kDVxs9gC3s2G6DS8kdNBJNVhMviCtin2DiBp'

const graphQLRequest = {
  method: 'post',
  url: queryUrl,
  data: {
    query: graphqlQuery,
  },
};

// Send the GraphQL query
axios(graphQLRequest)
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response here
    const data = response.data.data
    console.log(data)

  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors
    console.error(error);
  });
```
