Explore the GraphQL Query API for interacting with Subgraphs on The Graph Network.

## What is GraphQL?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. The Graph uses GraphQL to query Subgraphs.

## Core Concepts

### Entities

- **What they are**: Persistent data objects defined with `@entity` in your schema
- **Key requirement**: Must contain `id: ID!` as primary identifier
- **Usage**: Foundation for all query operations

### Schema

- **Purpose**: Blueprint defining the data structure and relationships using GraphQL [IDL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec-Type-System)
- **Key characteristics**:
  - Auto-generates query endpoints
  - Read-only operations (no mutations)
  - Defines entity interfaces and derived fields

## Queries with GraphQL

In the Subgraph schema, types called `Entities`. For each `Entity` type, `entity` and `entities` fields will be generated on the top-level `Query` type.

### Example Queries

> Note: `query` does not need to be included at the top of the `graphql` query when using The Graph.

Query for a single `Token` entity defined in your schema:

```graphql
{
  token(id: "1") {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

> Note: When querying for a single entity, the `id` field is required, and it must be written as a string.

Query all `Token` entities:

```graphql
{
  tokens {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

### Sorting

When querying a collection, you can:

- Use the `orderBy` parameter to sort by a specific attribute.
- Use the `orderDirection` to specify the sort direction, `asc` for ascending or `desc` for descending.

#### Example

```graphql
{
  tokens(orderBy: price, orderDirection: asc) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

#### Example for Nested Entity Sorting

As of Graph Node [`v0.30.0`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases/tag/v0.30.0) entities can be sorted on the basis of nested entities.

The following example shows tokens sorted by the name of their owner:

```graphql
{
  tokens(orderBy: owner__name, orderDirection: asc) {
    id
    owner {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

> Currently, you can sort by one-level deep `String` or `ID` types on `@entity` and `@derivedFrom` fields. Unfortunately, [sorting by interfaces on one level-deep entities](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/pull/4058), sorting by fields which are arrays and nested entities is not yet supported.

### Pagination

When querying a collection, it's best to:

- Use the `first` parameter to paginate from the beginning of the collection.
  - The default sort order is by `ID` in ascending alphanumeric order, **not** by creation time.
- Use the `skip` parameter to skip entities and paginate. For instance, `first:100` shows the first 100 entities and `first:100, skip:100` shows the next 100 entities.
- Avoid using `skip` values in queries because they generally perform poorly. To retrieve a large number of items, it's best to page through entities based on an attribute as shown in the previous example above.

#### Example Using `first`

Query the first 10 tokens:

```graphql
{
  tokens(first: 10) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

To query for groups of entities in the middle of a collection, the `skip` parameter can be used in conjunction with the `first` parameter to skip a specified number of entities starting at the beginning of the collection.

#### Example Using `first` and `skip`

Query 10 `Token` entities, offset by 10 places from the beginning of the collection:

```graphql
{
  tokens(first: 10, skip: 10) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

#### Example Using `first` and `id_ge`

If a client needs to retrieve a large number of entities, it's more performant to base queries on an attribute and filter by that attribute. For example, a client could retrieve a large number of tokens using this query:

```graphql
query manyTokens($lastID: String) {
  tokens(first: 1000, where: { id_gt: $lastID }) {
    id
    owner
  }
}
```

The first time, it would send the query with `lastID = ""`, and for subsequent requests it would set `lastID` to the `id` attribute of the last entity in the previous request. This approach will perform significantly better than using increasing `skip` values.

### Filtering

- You can use the `where` parameter in your queries to filter for different properties.
- You can filter on multiple values within the `where` parameter.

#### Using `where` Filtering

Query challenges with `failed` outcome using 'where' filter:

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { outcome: "failed" }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

You can use suffixes like `_gt`, `_lte` for value comparison:

#### Range Filtering

```graphql
{
  applications(where: { deposit_gt: "10000000000" }) {
    id
    whitelisted
    deposit
  }
}
```

#### Block Filtering

You can also filter entities that were updated in or after a specified block with `_change_block(number_gte: Int)`.

This can be useful if you are looking to fetch only entities which have changed, for example since the last time you polled. Or alternatively it can be useful to investigate or debug how entities are changing in your Subgraph (if combined with a block filter, you can isolate only entities that changed in a specific block).

```graphql
{
  applications(where: { _change_block: { number_gte: 100 } }) {
    id
    whitelisted
    deposit
  }
}
```

#### Nested Entity Filtering

Filtering on the basis of nested entities is possible in the fields with the `_` suffix.

This can be useful if you are looking to fetch only entities whose child-level entities meet the provided conditions.

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { application_: { id: 1 } }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Logical Operators

As of Graph Node [`v0.30.0`](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases/tag/v0.30.0) you can group multiple parameters in the same `where` argument using the `and` or the `or` operators to filter results based on more than one criteria.

#### Using `and` Operator

The following example filters for challenges with `outcome` `succeeded` and `number` greater than or equal to `100`.

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { and: [{ number_gte: 100 }, { outcome: "succeeded" }] }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

> **Syntactic sugar:** You can simplify the above query by removing the `and` operator by passing a sub-expression separated by commas.
>
> ```graphql
> {
>   challenges(where: { number_gte: 100, outcome: "succeeded" }) {
>     challenger
>     outcome
>     application {
>       id
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

#### Using `or` Operator

The following example filters for challenges with `outcome` `succeeded` or `number` greater than or equal to `100`.

```graphql
{
  challenges(where: { or: [{ number_gte: 100 }, { outcome: "succeeded" }] }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: When writing queries, it is important to consider the performance impact of using the `or` operator. While `or` can be a useful tool for broadening search results, it can also have significant costs. One of the main issues with `or` is that it can cause queries to slow down. This is because `or` requires the database to scan through multiple indexes, which can be a time-consuming process. To avoid these issues, it is recommended that developers use and operators instead of or whenever possible. This allows for more precise filtering and can lead to faster, more accurate queries.

#### All Filters

Full list of parameter suffixes:

```
_
_not
_gt
_lt
_gte
_lte
_in
_not_in
_contains
_contains_nocase
_not_contains
_not_contains_nocase
_starts_with
_starts_with_nocase
_ends_with
_ends_with_nocase
_not_starts_with
_not_starts_with_nocase
_not_ends_with
_not_ends_with_nocase
```

> Please note that some suffixes are only supported for specific types. For example, `Boolean` only supports `_not`, `_in`, and `_not_in`, but `_` is available only for object and interface types.

In addition, the following global filters are available as part of `where` argument:

```graphql
_change_block(number_gte: Int)
```

### Time-travel Queries

You can query the state of your entities not just for the latest block, which is the default, but also for an arbitrary block in the past. The block at which a query should happen can be specified either by its block number or its block hash by including a `block` argument in the toplevel fields of queries.

The result of such a query will not change over time, i.e., querying at a certain past block will return the same result no matter when it is executed, with the exception that if you query at a block very close to the head of the chain, the result might change if that block turns out to **not** be on the main chain and the chain gets reorganized. Once a block can be considered final, the result of the query will not change.

> Note: The current implementation is still subject to certain limitations that might violate these guarantees. The implementation can not always tell that a given block hash is not on the main chain at all, or if a query result by a block hash for a block that is not yet considered final could be influenced by a block reorganization running concurrently with the query. They do not affect the results of queries by block hash when the block is final and known to be on the main chain. [This issue](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/issues/1405) explains what these limitations are in detail.

#### Example Time-travel Queries

```graphql
{
  challenges(block: { number: 8000000 }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return `Challenge` entities, and their associated `Application` entities, as they existed directly after processing block number 8,000,000.

```graphql
{
  challenges(block: { hash: "0x5a0b54d5dc17e0aadc383d2db43b0a0d3e029c4c" }) {
    challenger
    outcome
    application {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return `Challenge` entities, and their associated `Application` entities, as they existed directly after processing the block with the given hash.

### Full-text Search Queries

Full-text search query fields provide an expressive text search API that can be added to the Subgraph schema and customized. Refer to [Defining Full-text Search Fields](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#defining-fulltext-search-fields) to add full-text search to your Subgraph.

Full-text search queries have one required field, `text`, for supplying search terms. Several special full-text operators are available to be used in this `text` search field.

Full-text search operators:

| Symbol | Operator | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `&` | `And` | For combining multiple search terms into a filter for entities that include all of the provided terms |
| `\|` | `Or` | Queries with multiple search terms separated by the or operator will return all entities with a match from any of the provided terms |
| `<->` | `Follow by` | Specify the distance between two words. |
| `:*` | `Prefix` | Use the prefix search term to find words whose prefix match (2 characters required.) |

#### Full-text Query Examples

Using the `or` operator, this query will filter to blog entities with variations of either "anarchism" or "crumpet" in their full-text fields.

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "anarchism | crumpets") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

The `follow by` operator specifies that two words must appear a specific distance apart in full-text documents.. The following query will return all blogs with variations of "decentralize" followed by "philosophy"

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "decentralized <-> philosophy") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

Combine full-text operators to make more complex filters. With a pretext search operator combined with a follow by this example query will match all blog entities with words that start with "lou" followed by "music".

```graphql
{
  blogSearch(text: "lou:* <-> music") {
    id
    title
    body
    author
  }
}
```

### Validation

Graph Node implements [specification-based](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Validation) validation of the GraphQL queries it receives using [graphql-tools-rs](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-tools-rs#validation-rules), which is based on the [graphql-js reference implementation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/tree/main/src/validation). Queries which fail a validation rule do so with a standard error - visit the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Validation) to learn more.

### Subgraph Metadata

All Subgraphs have an auto-generated `_Meta_` object, which provides access to Subgraph metadata. This can be queried as follows:

```graphQL
{
  _meta(block: { number: 123987 }) {
    block {
      number
      hash
      timestamp
    }
    deployment
    hasIndexingErrors
  }
}
```

If a block is provided, the metadata is as of that block, if not the latest indexed block is used. If provided, the block must be after the Subgraph's start block, and less than or equal to the most recently indexed block.

`deployment` is a unique ID, corresponding to the IPFS CID of the `subgraph.yaml` file.

`block` provides information about the latest block (taking into account any block constraints passed to `_meta`):

- hash: the hash of the block
- number: the block number
- timestamp: the timestamp of the block, if available (this is currently only available for Subgraphs indexing EVM networks)

`hasIndexingErrors` is a boolean identifying whether the Subgraph encountered indexing errors at some past block
