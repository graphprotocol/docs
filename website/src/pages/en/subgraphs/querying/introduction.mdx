To start querying right away, visit [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer). This guide shows you how to find a [Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/), generate a unique URL, and run queries.

## Overview

Querying a Subgraph with The Graph lets you access onchain data in a fast, reliable, and structured way, without running your own indexing infrastructure. This guide shows you how to get started so you can power your dapp or analysis with blockchain data.

## Steps

### Step 1: Locate Your Subgraph

After a Subgraph is published to The Graph Network, you can visit its Subgraph details page on Graph Explorer.

### Step 2: Retrieve the Query URL

On the Subgraph details page, click Query (top right) or scroll down. Each Subgraph published to The Graph Network has a unique query URL in Graph Explorer to make direct queries.

> Please see the [Query API](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/) for a complete reference on how to query the Subgraph's entities.

### Step 3: Manage Your API Key

Each query URL requires a valid API key. In [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio), locate the **API Keys** section to create or manage your keys. Learn more about how to use Subgraph Studio [here](/subgraphs/developing/deploying/using-subgraph-studio/).

### Step 4: Check Your Usage Plan

Subgraph Studio users start on a Free Plan, which allows them to make 100,000 queries per month. Additional queries are available on the Growth Plan, which offers usage based pricing for additional queries, payable by credit card, or GRT on Arbitrum. You can learn more about billing [here](/subgraphs/billing/).

## Handling Errors

If you encounter 405 errors with a GET request to the Graph Explorer URL, please switch to a POST request instead.
