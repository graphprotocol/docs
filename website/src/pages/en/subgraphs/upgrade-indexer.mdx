## Overview

The Upgrade Indexer is a specialized Indexer operated by Edge & Node. It supports newly integrated chains within The Graph ecosystem and ensures new Subgraphs are immediately available for querying, eliminating potential downtime.

Originally designed as a transitional support, its primary purpose was to facilitate the migration of Subgraphs from the hosted service to the decentralized network. Currently, it supports newly deployed Subgraphs before the full Chain Integration Process (CIP) Indexing rewards are activated.

### What it does

- Provides immediate query support for all newly deployed subgraphs.
- Functions as the sole supporting Indexer for each chain until indexing rewards are activated.

### What it does **not** do

- Does not permanently index subgraphs. Subgraph owners should curate subgraphs to use independent Indexers long term.
- Does not compete for rewards. The Upgrade Indexer's participation on the Graph Network does not dilute rewards for other Indexers.
- Doesn't support Time Travel Queries (TTQ). All Subgraphs on the Upgrade Indexer are auto-pruned. If TTQs are needed on a Subgraph, [curation signal can be added](/subgraphs/developing/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph) to attract Indexers that will support this feature.

### Conclusion

The Edge & Node Upgrade Indexer is foundational in supporting chain integrations and mitigating data latency risks. It plays a critical role in scaling The Graph's decentralized infrastructure by ensuring immediate query support and fostering community-driven indexing.
