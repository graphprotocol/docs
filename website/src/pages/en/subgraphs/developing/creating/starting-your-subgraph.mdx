title: Starting Your Subgraph
---

## Overview

The Graph is home to thousands of Subgraphs already available for query, so check [The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and find one that already matches your needs.

When you create a [Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/), you create a custom open API that extracts data from a blockchain, processes it, stores it, and makes it easy to query via GraphQL.

Subgraph development ranges from simple scaffold Subgraphs to advanced, specifically tailored Subgraphs.

### Start Building

Start the process and build a Subgraph that matches your needs:

1. [Install the CLI](/subgraphs/developing/creating/install-the-cli/) - Set up your infrastructure
2. [Subgraph Manifest](/subgraphs/developing/creating/subgraph-manifest/) - Understand a Subgraph's key component
3. [The GraphQL Schema](/subgraphs/developing/creating/ql-schema/) - Write your schema
4. [Writing AssemblyScript Mappings](/subgraphs/developing/creating/assemblyscript-mappings/) - Write your mappings
5. [Advanced Features](/subgraphs/developing/creating/advanced/) - Customize your Subgraph with advanced features

Explore additional [resources for APIs](/subgraphs/developing/creating/graph-ts/README/) and conduct local testing with [Matchstick](/subgraphs/developing/creating/unit-testing-framework/).
