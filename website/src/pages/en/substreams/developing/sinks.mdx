title: Sink your Substreams
---

Choose a sink that meets your project's needs.

## Overview

Once you find a package that fits your needs, you can choose how you want to consume the data.

Sinks are integrations that allow you to send the extracted data to different destinations, such as a SQL database, a file or a Subgraph.

## Sinks

> Note: Some of the sinks are officially supported by the StreamingFast core development team (i.e. active support is provided), but other sinks are community-driven and support can't be guaranteed.

- [SQL Database](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/sql-sink): Send the data to a database.
- [Subgraph](/sps/introduction/): Configure an API to meet your data needs and host it on The Graph Network.
- [Direct Streaming](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/stream): Stream data directly from your application.
- [PubSub](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/pubsub): Send data to a PubSub topic.
- [Community Sinks](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/community-sinks): Explore quality community maintained sinks.

> Important: If youâ€™d like your sink (e.g., SQL or PubSub) hosted for you, reach out to the StreamingFast team [here](mailto:sales@streamingfast.io).
