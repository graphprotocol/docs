The Token [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) MCP server connects Claude, Cline, and Cursor to onchain token data using natural language. This integration allows each model to fetch token metadata, track balances, analyze transfers, and surface holder insights without manual queries.

## What You Can Do

- Retrieve token metadata including name, symbol, decimals, total supply, and contract address
- Get token balances for any wallet address holding a supported ERC-20 token
- Fetch token transfer activity including sender, receiver, amount, and timestamp
- Identify top holders and analyze token distribution
- Ask natural language questions about token data without writing smart contract calls
- Access historical transfer data to analyze token movement over time

The Token MCP server provides [Claude](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/claude/), [Cline](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/cline/), and [Cursor](/ai-suite/token-api-mcp/cursor/) with direct, conversational access to onchain token data.
