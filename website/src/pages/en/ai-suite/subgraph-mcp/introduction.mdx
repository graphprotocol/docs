The Subgraph [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) MCP server connects large language models like Claude, Cline, and Cursor directly to Subgraphs on The Graph Network. This integration enables you to explore Subgraph data, run queries, and find relevant deployments using natural language prompts.

## What You Can Do

- Access GraphQL schemas for any Subgraph on The Graph Network
- Run GraphQL queries on any Subgraph deployment
- Discover top Subgraph deployments by keyword or contract address
- Retrieve 30-day query volumes for Subgraph deployments
- Ask questions about Subgraph data without writing GraphQL manually

The Subgraph MCP server allows smooth integration with [Claude](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/claude/), [Cline](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/cline/), or [Cursor](/ai-suite/subgraph-mcp/cursor/), making blockchain data queries with The Graph Network a conversational experience.
