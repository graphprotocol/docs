title: The Graph's AI

Build with speed and scale faster with The Graph's AI Suite.

## What is AI on The Graph?

AI on The Graph connects large language models (LLMs) like Claude to onchain data indexed by The Graph. This allows developers to build AI systems that query blockchain data directly using natural language. This eliminates the need to write code or manage infrastructure.

Instead of relying on static datasets or centralized APIs, you can now access live, verifiable blockchain data using [Graph Assistant](/ai-suite/graph-assistant/introduction/), [Subgraph MCP](), [Token API MCP]().

Fetch fast access to accurate, real-time onchain data.

## Why Use Onchain Data with AI?

If you're building with AI in web3, onchain data is necessary. Wallets, tokens, governance, and transactions all live onchain, but are often very difficult to access at scale without an indexing or custom solution.

The Graph solves this by making onchain data available through [Subgraphs]() and [TokenAPI]() via [Graph Assistant]().

### Benefits

- Easy access to data in real-time
- Save time and scale faster
- Fast access to indexed blockchain data
- Verifable answers tied to onchain activity
- Context-aware agents that interact with live data

There's no need to maintain backend infrastructure or manually pull and clean blockchain data.

## Conversational Querying with Graph Assistant

Graph Assistant allows Claude to understand and query The Graph using plain language. You describe what you want, and the assistant translates it into the correct query against a Subgraph or Token API endpoint.

**Example queries:**

- "List top holders of this token by balance."
- "Show GRT transfers to this address in the past 7 days."
- "Get proposals this wallet voted on in May."

[Graph Assistant](/ai-suite/graph-assistant/introduction/) uses the Model-Comprehensible Protocol (MCP) to understand data schemas, identify relevant fields, and return structured results.

You don't need to write GraphQL or study Subgraph schemas manually.

## Why This Matters for Developers

If you need fast access to token data, user behavior, governance activity, or protocol metrics, this stack gives you a direct path. You save time, avoid technical overhead, and can ship faster.

- No custom backend
- No manual querying
- No deep GraphQL knowledge required

You get verifiable blockchain data, ready for use in AI applications, chat interfaces, analytics dashboards, and automation workflows.
