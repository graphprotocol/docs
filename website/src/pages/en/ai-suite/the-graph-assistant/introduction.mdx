The Graph Assistant gives instant, code-free access to blockchain data, transforming natural language into precise, AI-powered queries without the need to code.

## Overview

### What is The Graph Assistant?

It's an advanced, agentic easy to use interface for querying blockchain data using natural language. It automatically interprets user intent, generates precise queries, executes them via The Graph and Token API, and presents structured, AI-powered answers without requiring any code.

Unlike traditional dashboards or chatbots, The Graph Assistant simplifies technical complexity and delivers composable insights directly from indexed subgraphs and token datasets.

## How to Use The Graph Assistant

You type a natural language question into the chat interface, such as:

```yaml
"What's the total number of DAI transfers on Optimism last week?"
```

### Behind the Scenes

The assistant:

1. Interprets your intent
2. Maps it to the correct Subgraphs or Token API endpoint
3. Executes optimized queries
4. Returns results as a clean, readable table.

You don't need to write queries or understand a Subgraph's schema, you simply ask.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Friendly Interface** | Conversational access to blockchain data via natural language. You simply ask questions, the assistant fetches the answer, and renders it as a table |
| **Backed by Subgraphs** | Uses subgraphs to index protocol-specific data like transactions, events, and protocol metrics |
| **Backed by Token API** | Uses Token API for token-level information like balances, transfers, and metadata. |
| **No Setup Required** | No need to configure data sources or write queries. |
| **Automatic Query Building** | The assistant performs complex queries such as fetching historical token volumes, protocol analytics, or cross-chain data and handles filtering, pagination, and joins across Subgraphs automatically. |
| **Supports Complex Data Needs** | Handles multi-chain, historical, and analytical requests (e.g., volume over time, asset flows, usage metrics). |
