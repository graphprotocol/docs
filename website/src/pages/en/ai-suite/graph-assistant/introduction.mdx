Graph Assistant gives instant, code-free access to blockchain data, transforming natural language into precise, AI-powered queries without the need to code.

## Overview

### What is Graph Assistant?

It's an advanced, agentic easy to use interface for querying blockchain data using natural language. It automatically interprets user intent, generates precise queries, executes them via The Graph's Subgraphs and Token API, and presents structured, AI-powered answers without requiring any code.

Unlike traditional dashboards or chatbots, Graph Assistant simplifies technical complexity and delivers composable insights directly from indexed subgraphs and token datasets.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Friendly Interface** | Conversational access to blockchain data via natural language. You simply ask questions, the assistant fetches the answer, and renders it as a table |
| **Backed by Subgraphs** | Uses subgraphs to index protocol-specific data like transactions, events, and protocol metrics |
| **Backed by Token API** | Uses Token API for token-level information like balances, transfers, and metadata. |
| **No Setup Required** | No need to configure data sources or write queries. |
| **Automatic Query Building** | The assistant performs complex queries such as fetching historical token volumes, protocol analytics, or cross-chain data and handles filtering, pagination, and joins across Subgraphs automatically. |
| **Supports Complex Data Needs** | Handles multi-chain, historical, and analytical requests (e.g., volume over time, asset flows, usage metrics). |
