Graph Assistant [BETA] gives instant, code-free access to blockchain data, transforming natural language into precise, AI-powered queries without the need to code.

## Overview

[Graph Assistant](https://graph-assistant.vercel.app/) is an advanced, [agentic](/en/ai-suite/graph-assistant/faq/) easy-to-use interface for querying blockchain data using natural language.

- **Automatically** interprets user intent, generates precise queries, executes them via The Graph's Subgraphs and Token API, and presents structured, AI-powered answers without requiring any code.
- **Removes** the technical complexity found in traditional dashboards or chatbots. It provides composable insights directly from indexed Subgraphs and Token datasets.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Friendly Interface** | Conversational access to blockchain data via natural language. You simply ask questions, the assistant fetches the answer, and renders it as a table |
| **Backed by Subgraphs** | Uses subgraphs to index protocol-specific data like transactions, events, and protocol metrics |
| **Backed by Token API** | Uses Token API for token-level information like balances, transfers, and metadata. |
| **No Setup Required** | No need to configure data sources or write queries. |
| **Automatic Query Building** | The assistant performs complex queries such as fetching historical token volumes, protocol analytics, or cross-chain data and handles filtering, pagination, and joins across Subgraphs automatically. |
