This page summarizes some of the most common questions for developers using Graph Assistant.

1. What is The Graph Assistant?

The Graph Assistant is an AI-powered chat interface that lets you query blockchain data in plain English. Under the hood, it translates your questions into GraphQL calls against Subgraphs and the Token API, then returns results, no coding required.

2. What is an agentic application?

An agentic application combines AI-driven reasoning with external data sources or APIs to take autonomous actions on your behalf. In this case, Graph Assistant acts as an “agent” that interprets your natural-language prompts, builds and dispatches GraphQL queries, and formats the results so that you don't need to write or manage queries yourself.

3. Which networks and data does Graph Assistant support?

The Assistant has access to Subgraphs across multiple chains. If a Subgraph is published to The Graph Network and is being indexed, the Assistant can automatically route queries to it. The Assistant also has access to the Token API on Ethereum Mainnet, BSC, Unichain, Arbitrum-One, Optimism, and Polygon.

4. Is there a usage limit or quota?

Yes, 10 questions per hour.

5. What if the Assistant can't interpret my question?

When the Assistant fails to parse your intent (for example, ambiguous token name, missing context, or an unsupported request), it will prompt you for clarification. For instance, it might ask, “Did you mean XYZ on Ethereum or XYZ on Arbitrum?” or “Please specify a date range for this query.” If you continue to see parsing errors, check that you're using correct token symbols or specifying networks and time frames clearly.
