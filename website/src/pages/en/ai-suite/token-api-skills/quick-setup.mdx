## Quick Setup

1. Create the skill directory and download the file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/token-api
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/token-api/SKILL.md https://token-api.service.stage.pinax.network/skills.md
```

2. Verify it works by typing `/token-api` in Claude Code.

That's it.

## Where Skills Live

| Location | Path | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | All your projects |
| Project | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Current project only |

For project-scoped usage (committed to Git so teammates get it too), use `.claude/skills/` in your repository.

## How It Works

- Claude Code auto-discovers `SKILL.md` files in `.claude/skills/` directories.
- Skills are invoked with `/skill-name` (e.g., `/token-api`).
- Skills can also be triggered automatically by Claude when relevant to your request.

## Keeping It Updated

If the remote file changes, re-run the `curl` command to fetch the latest version. You could also script this if needed.
