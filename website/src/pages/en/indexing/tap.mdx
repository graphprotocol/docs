title: GraphTally Guide
---

Learn about The Graph's new payment system, **GraphTally** [(previously Timeline Aggregation Protocol)](https://docs.rs/tap_core/latest/tap_core/index.html). This system provides fast, efficient microtransactions with minimized trust.

## Overview

GraphTally is a drop-in replacement to the Scalar payment system currently in place. It provides the following key features:

- Efficiently handles micropayments.
- Adds a layer of consolidations to onchain transactions and costs.
- Allows Indexers control of receipts and payments, guaranteeing payment for queries.
- Enables decentralized, trustless gateways and improves indexer service performance for multiple senders.

### How It Works

GraphTally allows a sender to make multiple payments to a receiver through **Receipts**, which are then aggregated into a single payment called a **Receipt Aggregate Voucher (RAV)**. This aggregated payment can be verified on the blockchain, reducing the number of transactions and simplifying the payment process.

For each query, the gateway sends a signed receipt that is stored in your database. The `indexer-tap-agent` aggregates these receipts into RAVs through periodic requests. You can update a RAV by sending it with newer receipts, which generates a new RAV with an increased value.

### RAV Details

- RAVs represent money waiting to be sent to the blockchain.
- The system continuously aggregates receipts to ensure that the total value of non-aggregated receipts does not exceed the configured `max_amount_willing_to_lose_grt`.
- Each RAV can be redeemed once in the contracts, which is why they are sent after the allocation is closed.

### Redeeming RAVs

The redemption process is fully automated when running both `indexer-tap-agent` and `indexer-agent`:

1. An Indexer closes an allocation.
2. After the `recently-closed-allocation-buffer` period, `indexer-tap-agent` takes all pending receipts for that allocation and requests aggregation into a final RAV, marking it as `last`.
3. `indexer-agent` takes all the last RAVs and sends redeem requests to the blockchain, updating the `redeem_at` value.
4. During the `finality-time` period, `indexer-agent` monitors for blockchain reorganizations:
   - If the transaction was reverted, the RAV is resent to the blockchain.
   - If not reverted, it gets marked as `final`.

## Prerequisites

In addition to typical indexer requirements, you'll need a `tap-escrow-subgraph` endpoint to query escrow information. You can use The Graph Network to query or self-host on your `graph-node`:

- [Graph TAP Arbitrum Sepolia Subgraph (for The Graph testnet)](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/7ubx365MiqBH5iUz6XWXWT8PTof5BVAyEzdb8m17RvbD)
- [Graph TAP Arbitrum One Subgraph (for The Graph mainnet)](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/4sukbNVTzGELnhdnpyPqsf1QqtzNHEYKKmJkgaT8z6M1)

> Note: `indexer-agent` does not currently handle the indexing of this Subgraph like it does for the Network Subgraph deployment. You must index it manually.

## Migration Guide

### Software Requirements

#### Required Versions

- **indexer-agent**: [Latest version supporting TAP](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/releases)
- **indexer-service-rs**: [Latest release](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs/releases?q=indexer-service-rs)
- **indexer-tap-agent**: [Latest release](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs/releases?q=indexer-tap-agent)

#### Docker Images

```bash
# Indexer Service
docker pull ghcr.io/graphprotocol/indexer-service-rs:latest

# TAP Agent
docker pull ghcr.io/graphprotocol/indexer-tap-agent:latest
```

### Migration Steps

#### 1. Update Indexer Agent

- Continue using your existing `indexer-agent`
- Add the `--tap-subgraph-endpoint` argument to enable TAP functionality and RAV redemption
- Example: `--tap-subgraph-endpoint https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/graphprotocol/tap-mainnet`

#### 2. Replace Indexer Service

- Fully replace your TypeScript indexer-service with `indexer-service-rs`
- The new service is stateless and can be scaled horizontally
- Use the same database as your existing setup

#### 3. Deploy TAP Agent

- Run exactly **one instance** of `indexer-tap-agent`
- This component manages receipt aggregation and RAV creation
- It must have access to the same database as other indexer components

#### 4. Configuration

Both `indexer-service-rs` and `indexer-tap-agent` share a TOML configuration file. Create a configuration file and pass it with `--config /path/to/config.toml`.

##### Minimal Configuration Example

```toml
# Essential configuration for indexer-rs components
# All values below must be updated to match your setup

[indexer]
indexer_address = "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
operator_mnemonic = "your twelve word mnemonic phrase here ..."

[database]
# Use the same database as your indexer-agent
postgres_url = "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/indexer_db"

[graph_node]
# Your graph-node endpoints
query_url = "http://graph-node:8000"
status_url = "http://graph-node:8000/graphql"

[subgraphs.network]
# The Graph Network Subgraph (use query_url OR deployment_id, not both)
query_url = "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/graphprotocol/graph-network-arbitrum"
# deployment_id = "QmUVskWrz1ZiQZ76AtyhcfFDEH1ELnRpoyEhVL8p6NFTbR"

[subgraphs.escrow]
# TAP Escrow Subgraph (use query_url OR deployment_id, not both)
query_url = "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/graphprotocol/tap-arbitrum-one"
# deployment_id = "QmPcbDomKwfsmVBNbvncU8gdWTvUiH9zVFYxDMc5ohpjvU"

[blockchain]
# For Arbitrum mainnet
chain_id = 42161
receipts_verifier_address = "0x33f9E93266ce0E108fc85DdE2f71dab555A0F05a"

# For Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, use:
# chain_id = 421614
# receipts_verifier_address = "0xfC24cE7a4428A6B89B52645243662A02BA734ECF"

[tap]
# Maximum GRT amount to risk before requiring aggregation
# Use string format to prevent rounding errors
max_amount_willing_to_lose_grt = "0.1"

[tap.sender_aggregator_endpoints]
# Gateway endpoints for RAV aggregation
# Mainnet
"0xDDE4cfFd3D9052A9cb618fC05a1Cd02be1f2F467" = "https://tap-aggregator.network.thegraph.com"

# For testnet, use:
# "0xC3dDf37906724732FfD748057FEBe23379b0710D" = "https://tap-aggregator.testnet.thegraph.com"
```

##### Environment Variable Overrides

You can override any configuration value using environment variables:

```bash
# Pattern: [PREFIX]__[SECTION]__[KEY]
# PREFIX can be INDEXER_SERVICE or TAP_AGENT

# Examples:
export INDEXER_SERVICE__DATABASE__POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://..."
export TAP_AGENT__TAP__MAX_AMOUNT_WILLING_TO_LOSE_GRT="0.5"
export INDEXER_SERVICE__BLOCKCHAIN__RECEIPTS_VERIFIER_ADDRESS="0x..."
```

##### Advanced Configuration

For all configuration options, see:

- [Full configuration example](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs/blob/main/crates/config/maximal-config-example.toml)
- [Default values](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs/blob/main/crates/config/default_values.toml)

### Logging

Set the log level using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
# Recommended for production
export RUST_LOG=indexer_service=info,indexer_tap_agent=info

# For debugging
export RUST_LOG=indexer_service=debug,indexer_tap_agent=debug

# TAP-specific debugging
export RUST_LOG=indexer_tap_agent=debug,info
```

## Monitoring

### Metrics

All components expose Prometheus metrics on port 7300:

- `http://indexer-service:7300/metrics`
- `http://tap-agent:7300/metrics`

Key metrics to monitor:

- **Receipt Processing**: Track receipt validation, aggregation rates, and failures
- **RAV Creation**: Monitor RAV request success/failure rates
- **Unaggregated Fees**: Ensure fees stay below `max_amount_willing_to_lose_grt`
- **Sender Balances**: Track escrow account balances and obligations

### Grafana Dashboard

Import the [official Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer-rs/blob/main/docs/dashboard.json) for comprehensive monitoring of:

- TAP receipt flow and aggregation status
- RAV creation and redemption lifecycle
- System performance and error rates
- Database query performance

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **RAV requests failing**:
   - Check aggregator endpoint connectivity
   - Verify sender configuration in `tap.sender_aggregator_endpoints`
   - Review debug logs for specific error messages

2. **Receipts not aggregating**:
   - Ensure `tap-agent` is running (only one instance)
   - Check database connectivity
   - Verify `max_amount_willing_to_lose_grt` is not too high

3. **High unaggregated fees**:
   - Lower `max_amount_willing_to_lose_grt` to trigger more frequent aggregation
   - Check if specific senders are having aggregation issues
   - Monitor the Grafana dashboard for aggregation patterns

## Deployment Options

### Docker Compose

Example compose configuration for both services:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  indexer-service:
    image: ghcr.io/graphprotocol/indexer-service-rs:latest
    ports:
      - '7600:7600' # Service port
      - '7300:7300' # Metrics port
    volumes:
      - ./config.toml:/config.toml
    command: ['--config', '/config.toml']
    environment:
      - RUST_LOG=indexer_service=info
    restart: unless-stopped

  tap-agent:
    image: ghcr.io/graphprotocol/indexer-tap-agent:latest
    ports:
      - '7301:7300' # Metrics port (different host port)
    volumes:
      - ./config.toml:/config.toml
    command: ['--config', '/config.toml']
    environment:
      - RUST_LOG=indexer_tap_agent=info
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Kubernetes

For Kubernetes deployments, see the [Graph Launchpad charts](https://github.com/graphops/launchpad-charts/tree/main/charts/graph-network-indexer) which include:

- Helm charts for both services
- ConfigMap templates for configuration
- Service and ingress definitions
- Prometheus ServiceMonitor resources

## Best Practices

1. **Database Performance**:
   - Ensure your PostgreSQL instance has adequate resources
   - Monitor query performance through metrics
   - Regular maintenance of receipt tables

2. **High Availability**:
   - Run multiple `indexer-service-rs` instances behind a load balancer
   - Keep `tap-agent` as a single instance with proper monitoring
   - Use database connection pooling

3. **Security**:
   - Store operator mnemonic securely (use environment variables)
   - Restrict database access to indexer components only
   - Monitor for unusual receipt patterns

4. **Capacity Planning**:
   - Monitor receipt growth rate
   - Plan database storage accordingly
   - Set appropriate `max_amount_willing_to_lose_grt` based on query volume
