## Time Intervals and Parameters

1. **Full historical data** is available on all plans.
2. **Pagination** is still required to fetch all results.
3. You can use **`start_time`** and **`end_time`** to move your time window across history.
   - **Example**: `start_time=2025-01-01`, `end_time=2025-01-28`, and `interval=4h` (Free plan) will return 28 days of data for that range.
