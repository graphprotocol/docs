## Time Intervals and Parameters (\*)

1. The **time interval window** is calculated as: **`bars × interval`**.
   - **Example**: The Free plan provides 168 bars with a 4h interval: 168 × 4h = 28 days of data.
2. **Full historical data** is available on all plans.
3. **Pagination** is still required to fetch all results. Users won't receive more data than the plan's total bar limit.
   - **Example**: The Free plan allows 168 bars and a 10-result limit per query, so you'll need 17 queries to retrieve all pages.
4. You can use **`start_time`** and **`end_time`** to move your time window across history.
   - **Example**: `start_time=2025-01-01`, `end_time=2025-01-28`, and `interval=4h` (Free plan) will return 28 days of data for that range.
