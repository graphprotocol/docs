## Explanation

### What is The Graph?

The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. Its data services include:

- [Subgraphs](/subgraphs/developing/subgraphs/)
- [Substreams](/substreams/introduction/)
- [Token API Beta](/token-api/quick-start/)

The ecosystem maintains additional tooling that includes:

- [Graph Explorer](/subgraphs/explorer/)
- [Subgraph Studio](/subgraphs/developing/deploying/using-subgraph-studio/)

The Graph supports [90+ blockchains](/supported-networks/), enhancing dapp development and data retrieval.

### Why is Blockchain Data Hard to Query?

Reading data from blockchains (e.g., ownership history, metadata, relationships between assets) often requires processing smart contract events, parsing metadata from IPFS, and manually aggregating data.

This is slow, complex, and resource-intensive.

## Solution

### How The Graph Solves This

The Graph simplifies the complex process of retrieving blockchain data through a global, decentralized network of Indexers that index Subgraphs. This infrastructure facilitates efficient, censorship-resistant query handling, allowing developers to build applications using blockchain data without the hassle of managing servers or custom indexing.

Each Subgraph defines:

- Which smart contracts to watch
- Which events to extract
- How to map event data into a queryable format using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)

### [Building a Subgraph](/subgraphs/developing/creating/starting-your-subgraph/)

1. Define a [Subgraph Manifest](/subgraphs/developing/creating/subgraph-manifest/) with data sources and mappings.
2. Use [Graph CLI](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling/tree/main/packages/cli) to deploy the manifest to IPFS.
3. An [Indexer](/indexing/overview/) picks it up and starts indexing Ethereum blocks.
4. Data becomes queryable via a [GraphQL endpoint](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/).
