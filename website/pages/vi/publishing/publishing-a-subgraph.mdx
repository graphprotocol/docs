title: Publishing a Subgraph to the Decentralized Network
---

Once your subgraph has been [deployed to the Subgraph Studio](/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio), you have tested it out, and are ready to put it into production, you can then publish it to the decentralized network.

Publishing a Subgraph to the decentralized network makes it available for [Curators](/network/curating) to begin curating on it, and [Indexers](/network/indexing) to begin indexing it.

You can find the list of the supported networks [Here](/developing/supported-networks).

## Publishing a subgraph

Các Subgraph có thể được xuất bản lên mạng phi tập trung trực tiếp từ bảng điều khiển Subgraph Studio bằng cách nhấp vào nút **Xuất bản** (Publish). Khi một subgraph được xuất bản, nó sẽ khả dụng để xem trong [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/).

- Subgraphs can be published to Goerli, Arbitrum goerli, Arbitrum One, or Ethereum mainnet.

- Regardless of the network the subgraph was published on, it can index data on any of the [supported networks](/developing/supported-networks).

- Khi xuất bản một phiên bản mới cho một subgraph hiện có, các quy tắc tương tự sẽ được áp dụng như trên.

## Curating your subgraph

> It is recommended that you curate your own subgraph with 10,000 GRT to ensure that it is indexed and available for querying as soon as possible.

Subgraph Studio enables you to be the first to curate your subgraph by adding GRT to your subgraph's curation pool in the same transaction. When publishing your subgraph, make sure to check the button that says, "Be the first to signal on this subgraph."

## Updating metadata for a published subgraph

Once your subgraph has been published to the decentralized network, you can modify the metadata at any time by making the update in the Subgraph Studio dashboard of the subgraph. After saving the changes and publishing your updates to the network, they will be reflected in The Graph Explorer. This won’t create a new version, as your deployment hasn’t changed.
