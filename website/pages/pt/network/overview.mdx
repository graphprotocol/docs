title: Visão Geral da Rede
---

The Graph Network is a decentralized indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. Applications use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs and retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, developers can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

## Visão Geral

The Graph Network consists of Indexers, Curators, and Delegators that provide services to the network and serve data to Web3 applications. Consumers use the applications and consume the data.

Para garantir a segurança económica da Graph Network, e a integridade de dados em consultas, os participantes depositam e usam Graph Tokens ([GRT](/tokenomics)). O GRT é um token de utilidade de trabalho ERC-20 usado para alocar recursos na rede.

Active Indexers, Curators, and Delegators can provide services and earn income from the network, proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake.
