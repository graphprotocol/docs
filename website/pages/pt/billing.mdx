## Subgraph Billing Plans

There are two plans to use when querying subgraphs on The Graph Network.

- **Free Plan**: The Free Plan includes 100,000 free monthly queries with full access to the Subgraph Studio testing environment. This plan is designed for hobbyists, hackathoners, and those with side projects to try out The Graph before scaling their dapp.

- **Growth Plan**: The Growth Plan includes everything in the Free Plan with all queries after 100,000 monthly queries requiring payments with GRT or credit card. The Growth Plan is flexible enough to cover teams that have established dapps across a variety of use cases.

## Query Payments with credit card

- To set up billing with credit/debit cards, users will access Subgraph Studio (https://thegraph.com/studio/)
  1. Go to the [Subgraph Studio Billing page](https://thegraph.com/studio/billing/).
  2. Clique no botão "Connect Wallet" (Conectar Carteira) no canto superior direito da página. Isto levará à página de seleção de carteira; lá, selecione a sua carteira e clique em "Connect".
  3. Choose “Upgrade plan” if you are upgrading from the Free Plan or choose “Manage Plan” if you have already added GRT to your billing balance in the past. Next, you can estimate the number of queries to get a pricing estimate, but this is not a required step.
  4. To choose a credit card payment, choose “Credit card” as the payment method and fill out your credit card information. Those who have used Stripe before can use the Link feature to autofill their details.
- Invoices will be processed at the end of each month and require an active credit card on file for all queries beyond the free plan quota.

## Query Payments with GRT

Subgraph users can use The Graph Token (or GRT) to pay for queries on The Graph Network. With GRT, invoices will be processed at the end of each month and require a sufficient balance of GRT to make queries beyond the Free Plan quota of 100,000 monthly queries. You'll be required to pay fees generated from your API keys. Using the billing contract, you'll be able to:

- Depositar e sacar GRT do seu saldo.
- Acompanhar os seus balanços com base em quanto GRT depositou ao seu saldo, quanto retirou, e nos seus recibos.
- Pagar recibos automaticamente com base nas taxas de query geradas, desde que tenha GRT suficiente no seu saldo.

### GRT on Arbitrum or Ethereum

The Graph’s billing system accepts GRT from either Arbitrum or Ethereum, but users will need ETH on Arbitrum to pay for gas. While The Graph protocol started on Ethereum Mainnet, most activity, including all of the billing contracts, are on Arbitrum One. Although setting up billing with GRT on Arbitrum will process more quickly, users do not need to bridge GRT to Arbitrum before setting up billing for The Graph Network.

> This section is written assuming you already have GRT in your wallet, and you're on Ethereum mainnet. If you don't have GRT, you can learn how to get GRT [here](#getting-grt).

### Adding GRT using a wallet

1. Go to the [Subgraph Studio Billing page](https://thegraph.com/studio/billing/).
2. Clique no botão "Connect Wallet" (Conectar Carteira) no canto superior direito da página. Isto levará à página de seleção de carteira; lá, selecione a sua carteira e clique em "Connect".
3. Select the "Manage" button near the top right corner. First time users will see an option to "Upgrade to Growth plan" while returning users will click "Deposit from wallet".
4. Use the slider to estimate the number of queries you expect to make on a monthly basis.
   - For suggestions on the number of queries you may use, see our **Frequently Asked Questions** page.
5. Choose "Cryptocurrency". GRT is currently the only cryptocurrency accepted on The Graph Network.
6. Select the number of months you would like to prepay.
   - Paying in advance does not commit you to future usage. You will only be charged for what you use and you can withdraw your balance at any time.
7. Pick the network from which you are depositing your GRT. GRT on Arbitrum or Ethereum are both acceptable.
8. Click "Allow GRT Access" and then specify the amount of GRT that can be taken from you wallet.
   - If you are prepaying for multiple months, you must allow access to the amount that corresponds with that amount. This interaction will not cost any gas.
9. Lastly, click on "Add GRT to Billing Balance". This transaction will require ETH on Arbitrum to cover the gas costs.

- Note that GRT deposited from Arbitrum will process within a few moments while GRT deposited from Ethereum will take approximately 15-20 minutes to process. Once the transaction is confirmed, you'll see the GRT added to your account balance.

## Billing FAQs

### How many queries will I need?

You don't need to know how many queries you'll need in advance. You will only be charged for what you use and you can withdrawal GRT from your account at any time.

We recommend you overestimate the number of queries you will need so that you don’t have to top up your balance frequently. A good estimate for small to medium sized applications is to start with 1M-2M queries per month and monitor usage closely in the first weeks. For larger apps, a good estimate is to use the number of daily visits your site gets multiplied by the number of queries your most active page makes upon opening.

Of course, both new and existing users can reach out to Edge & Node's BD team for a consult to learn more about anticipated usage.

### Can I withdraw GRT from my billing balance?

Yes, you can always withdraw GRT that has not already been used for queries from your billing balance. The billing contract is only designed to bridge GRT from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum network. If you'd like to transfer your GRT from Arbitrum back to Ethereum mainnet, you'll need to use the [Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161).

### What happens when my billing balance runs? Will I get a warning?

You will receive several email notifications before your billing balance runs out.

### Which chain does GRT need to be on?

Subgraph Studio's GRT billing is deployed on Arbitrum. You can bridge GRT and ETH from mainnet Ethereum using any of the following options:

- [The Arbitrum Bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
- [TransferTo](https://transferto.xyz/swap)
- [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/)
- [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/#/send?token=ETH)
