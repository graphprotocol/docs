title: Queries no The Graph
---

When a subgraph is published to The Graph Network, you can visit its subgraph details page on [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) and use the "query" tab to explore the deployed GraphQL API for the subgraph, issuing queries and viewing the schema.

> Please see the [Query API](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/) for a complete reference on how to query the subgraph's entities. You can learn about GraphQL querying best practices [here](/subgraphs/querying/best-practices/)
>
> Nota: Se encontrar erros 405 com um pedido GET ao URL do Graph Explorer, use um pedido POST.

Cada subgraph publicado à Graph Network tem um URL singular de query no Graph Explorer para fazer queries diretos que podem ser encontrados ao navegar até a página de detalhes do subgraph e clicar no botão "Query" no canto superior direito.

Learn more about querying from an application [here](/subgraphs/querying/from-an-application/).

As you can notice, this query URL must use a unique API key. You can create and manage your API keys in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio), in the "API Keys" section. Learn more about how to use Subgraph Studio [here](/deploying/subgraph-studio/).

Subgraph Studio users start on a Free Plan, which allows them to make 100,000 queries per month. Additional queries are available on the Growth Plan, which offers usage based pricing for additional queries, payable by credit card, or GRT on Arbitrum. You can learn more about billing [here](/subgraphs/billing/).
