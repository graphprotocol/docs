## O Que √â o Nascer do Sol dos Dados Descentralizados?

O Nascer do Sol dos Dados Descentralizados √© uma iniciativa liderada pela Edge & Node. A meta √© garantir que os programadores de subgraphs fa√ßam uma atualiza√ß√£o suave para a rede descentralizada do The Graph.

Este plano usa v√°rios desenvolvimentos pr√©vios do ecossistema do The Graph, inclusive um Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o para servir queries em subgraphs rec√©m-publicados, e a habilidade de integrar novas redes de blockchain ao The Graph.

### Quais as fases do Nascer do Sol?

**Sunray**: Enable support for hosted service chains, introduce a seamless upgrade flow, offer a free plan on The Graph Network, and provide simple payment options.\
**Sunbeam**: The upgrade window that subgraph developers will have to upgrade their hosted service subgraphs to The Graph Network. This window will end at 10 a.m. PT on June 12th 2024.\
**Sunrise**: Hosted service endpoints will no longer be available after 10 a.m. PT on June 12th, 2024.

## Atualiza√ß√£o de subgraphs √† Graph Network

### When will hosted service subgraphs no longer be available?

Hosted service query endpoints will remain active until 10 a.m. PT on June 12th. After June 12th at 10 a.m. PT, query endpoints will no longer be available, and developers will no longer be able to deploy new subgraph versions on the hosted service.

### I didn‚Äôt upgrade my subgraph by June 12th at 10 a.m. PT. What should I do if I still want to use it?

The hosted service homepage is still accessible and can be used to search for legacy hosted service subgraphs. If your hosted service subgraph has already been auto-upgraded, you may claim its network equivalent as the original owner. If your subgraph was not [auto-upgraded subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/blog/unveiling-updated-sunrise-decentralized-data/#phase-2-sunbeam), you can still upgrade and publish it.

Upgrading takes less than five minutes on average. Once your subgraph is up, simply set up an API key in Subgraph Studio, update your API query endpoint, and begin querying!

### Will my hosted service subgraph be supported on The Graph Network?

Yes, the upgrade Indexer will automatically support all hosted service subgraphs published to The Graph Network for a seamless upgrade experience.

### How do I upgrade my hosted service subgraph?

> Note: Upgrading a subgraph to The Graph Network cannot be undone.

<VideoEmbed youtube="hCmX5Dlhdjw" />

To upgrade a hosted service subgraph, you can visit the subgraph dashboard on the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service).

1. Select the subgraph(s) you want to upgrade.
2. Select the receiving wallet (the wallet that will become the owner of the subgraph).
3. Click the "Upgrade" button.

Once your subgraph is published, the [upgrade Indexer](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) will begin serving queries on it. Once you have generated an API key, you can begin making queries immediately. [Learn more](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph/#what-next).

### How can I get support with the upgrade process?

The Graph community is here to support developers as they move to The Graph Network. Join The Graph's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) and request help in the #upgrade-decentralized-network channel.

### How can I ensure high quality of service and redundancy for subgraphs on The Graph Network?

All subgraphs will be supported by the upgrade Indexer. For a higher quality of service and more robust redundancy, you can add a curation signal to subgraphs eligible for indexing rewards. It is recommended that you curate your subgraph with at least 3000 GRT (per subgraph) to attract about 3 Indexers. [Learn more about adding signal to your subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph).

Please note that this indexing incentive does not deplete over time; it has no depletion rate and is instantly withdrawable at any time. If you want to add 3000 GRT in signal, you will need to signal 3030 GRT (as 1% would be burned). Note that a 0.5% fee is also deducted from the subgraph‚Äôs signal every time a new version is published.

Subgraphs which are not eligible for indexing rewards may struggle to attract further Indexers. For example, indexing rewards may not be available for subgraphs on certain chains (check support [here](/developing/supported-networks)).

Members from these blockchain communities are encouraged to integrate their chain through the [Chain Integration Process](/chain-integration-overview/).

### How do I publish new versions to the network?

You can deploy new versions of your subgraph directly to Subgraph Studio, which provides a testing environment, before publishing to the network for production usage. Subgraph Studio has a different deployment command and requires a `version-label` for each new deployment.

1. Upgrade to the latest version of [graph-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
2. Update your deploy command

```sh
#¬†Authorize with Subgraph Studio, available on your subgraph page
## Alternativel pass this into the deploy command as --access-token (see below)
graph auth --studio <deploy-key>

# Deploy to Subgraph Studio
## Unlike the hosted service, the name is just the subgraph name (no github id)
## If using `--node` directly, you can pass in https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
graph deploy --studio --version <version> --access-token <deploy-key> <subgraph-name>
```

This new version will then sync in Subgraph Studio, a testing and sandbox environment. When you are ready to move a new version to production, you can [publish the subgraph version](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph).

> Publishing requires Arbitrum ETH - upgrading your subgraph also airdrops a small amount to facilitate your first protocol interactions üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

### I use a subgraph developed by someone else, how can I make sure that my service isn't interrupted?

When the owner has upgraded their subgraph, you will be able to easily go from the subgraph's hosted service page to the corresponding subgraph on The Graph Network, and update your application to use the new subgraph's query URL. [Learn more](/querying/querying-the-graph).

Around the start of June, Edge & Node will automatically upgrade actively queried subgraphs. This will give any third-party data consumers an opportunity to move subgraph endpoints to The Graph Network before 10 a.m. on June 12th. The subgraph owners will still be able to claim these subgraphs on the network using the hosted service upgrade flow.

### My subgraph has been auto-upgraded, what does that mean?

Subgraphs on the hosted service are open APIs, and many subgraphs are relied upon by third-party developers to build their applications. To give those developers sufficient time to move to The Graph Network, Edge & Node will be "auto-upgrading" highly used subgraphs. A link to the "auto-upgraded" subgraph will be visible on the original subgraph's page on the hosted service.

Owners of "auto-upgraded" subgraphs can easily claim their upgraded subgraphs using the same [upgrade flow](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph) - such subgraphs can be identified by their "auto-upgraded" tag. Ownership of the subgraph on The Graph Network will be transferred to the owner's wallet.

### My subgraph has been auto-upgraded, but I need to deploy a new version

You can use the [upgrade flow](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph) to claim the auto-upgraded subgraph, and then you can deploy a new version in Subgraph Studio, using the same infrastructure that powers the hosted service.

If you require an urgent fix, please contact support.

### What happens if I don't upgrade my subgraph?

Subgraphs will be queryable on the hosted service until 10 a.m. PT on June 12th. After this date, the hosted service homepage will still be accessible, however, query endpoints will no longer be available. Owners of hosted service subgraphs will still be able to upgrade their subgraphs to The Graph Network after June 12th, though earlier upgrades are entitled to [earn rewards](https://thegraph.com/sunrise-upgrade-program/). Developers will also be able to claim [auto-upgraded subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/blog/unveiling-updated-sunrise-decentralized-data/#phase-2-sunbeam).

### What should I do with my subgraphs on the hosted service? Will they stop working and should I delete them?

It is not possible to delete subgraphs. Query endpoints will remain active until 10 a.m. PT on June 12th, regardless of whether they have been upgraded or not.

### Will Subgraph Studio be impacted by this upgrade?

No, Subgraph Studio will not be impacted by Sunrise.

### What will happen to the hosted service?

After 10 a.m. PT on June 12th, query endpoints will no longer be available, and owners won't be able to deploy or query the hosted service. However, the hosted service UI will still show subgraph pages, and subgraph owners will be able to upgrade their subgraphs if they haven't already. The hosted service UI will be retired at a later date.

### Will subgraphs need to be re-indexed again?

No, rest assured that your subgraph will not need to be re-indexed when it is upgraded to The Graph Network. Subgraphs will be immediately available for querying, powered by the upgrade Indexer, which uses the same infrastructure as the hosted service. If your subgraph is indexing a network that is eligible for indexing rewards, you can add signal to attract indexers. [Learn more about adding signal to your subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph).

### I‚Äôm experiencing indexing issues. What should I do?

Rest assured that network Indexers are prepared to provide support during this upgrade. If you experience issues with any of your subgraph queries, please reach out to support@thegraph.zendesk.com

### Why is my subgraph being published to Arbitrum, is it indexing a different network?

The Graph Network was originally deployed on mainnet Ethereum but moved to Arbitrum One to reduce gas costs for all users. As such any new subgraphs are published to The Graph Network on Arbitrum so that they can be supported by Indexers. Arbitrum is the network that subgraphs are published to, but subgraphs can index any of the [supported networks](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/supported-networks/)

### How can I get started querying subgraphs on The Graph Network?

You can explore available subgraphs on [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer). [Learn more about querying subgraphs on The Graph](/querying/querying-the-graph).

## About the Upgrade Indexer

### What is the upgrade Indexer?

The upgrade Indexer is designed to improve the experience of upgrading subgraphs from the hosted service to The Graph Network and to support new versions of existing subgraphs that have not yet been indexed.

The upgrade Indexer aims to bootstrap chains that don't have indexing rewards yet on The Graph Network and to serve as a fallback for new subgraph versions. The goal is to ensure that an Indexer is available to serve queries as quickly as possible after a subgraph is published.

### What chains does the upgrade Indexer support?

The upgrade Indexer supports chains that were previously only available on the hosted service.

Encontre uma lista compreensiva de chains apoiadas [aqui](/developing/supported-networks/).

### Porque a Edge & Node executa o Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o?

Edge & Node has historically maintained the hosted service and, as a result, has already synced data for hosted service subgraphs.

All Indexers are encouraged to become upgrade Indexers as well. However, note that operating an upgrade Indexer is primarily a public service to support new subgraphs and additional chains that lack indexing rewards before they are approved by The Graph Council.

### What does the upgrade indexer mean for existing Indexers?

Chains that were previously only supported on the hosted service will now be available to developers on The Graph Network without indexing rewards at first, but it will unlock query fees for any Indexer that is interested. This should lead to an increase in the number of subgraphs being published on The Graph Network, providing more opportunities for Indexers to index and serve these subgraphs in return for query fees, even before indexing rewards are enabled for a chain.

O Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o tamb√©m fornece √† comunidade de Indexadores informa√ß√µes sobre demanda em potencial para subgraphs e novas chains na Graph Network.

### O que isto significa para Delegantes?

O Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o oferece uma forte oportunidade para Delegantes. √Ä medida que mais subgraphs s√£o atualizados do servi√ßo hospedado at√© a Graph Network, os Delegantes podem se beneficiar do aumento na atividade da rede.

### O Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o concorrer√° com Indexadores existentes para recompensas?

N√£o, o Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o s√≥ alocar√° a quantidade m√≠nima por subgraph e n√£o coletar√° recompensas de indexa√ß√£o.

It operates on an ‚Äúas needed‚Äù basis and serves as a fallback until sufficient service quality is achieved by at least 3 other Indexers in the network for respective chains and subgraphs.

### Como isto afetar√° os programadores de subgraph?

Subgraph developers will be able to query their subgraphs on The Graph Network almost immediately after upgrading from the hosted service or publishing from Subgraph Studio, as no lead time will be required for indexing.

### Como isto beneficiar√° os consumidores de dados?

O Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o ativa, na rede, chains que antes s√≥ tinham apoio no servi√ßo hospedado. Assim, ele aumenta o alcance e a disponibilidade de dados que podem ser consultados na rede.

### Como o Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o precificar√° queries?

O Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o precificar√° queries no pre√ßo do mercado, para n√£o influenciar o mercado de taxas de queries.

### Quais s√£o os crit√©rios para que o Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o pare de apoiar um subgraph?

O Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o servir√° um subgraph at√© ele for servido suficientemente e com √™xito, com queries consistentes servidos por, no m√≠nimo, 3 outros Indexadores.

Al√©m disto, o Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o parar√° de apoiar um subgraph se ele n√£o tiver sido consultado nos √∫ltimos 30 dias.

Other Indexers are incentivized to support subgraphs with ongoing query volume. The query volume to the upgrade Indexer should trend towards zero, as it will have a small allocation size, and other Indexers will be chosen for queries ahead of it.

## Sobre a Graph Network

### Eu tenho que executar a minha pr√≥pria infraestrutura?

N√£o. Toda a infraestrutura √© operada por Indexadores independentes na Graph Network, o que inclui o Indexador de atualiza√ß√µes ([leia mais abaixo](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer)).

√â poss√≠vel usar o [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) para criar, testar e editar o seu subgraph. Todos os utilizadores do servi√ßo hospedado devem migrar o seu subgraph √† Graph Network antes das 10 da manh√£, hor√°rio Pac√≠fico, em 12 de junho de 2024.

O [Indexador de Atualiza√ß√£o do Nascer do Sol](/sunrise/#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) garante a indexa√ß√£o de todos os subgraphs. No entanto, sinalizar GRT em um subgraph em particular atrair√° mais Indexadores a ele. Este incentivo de Indexadores adicionais via curadoria visa melhorar a qualidade do servi√ßo de queries ao reduzir a lat√™ncia e melhorar a disponibilidade da rede.

Ao sinalizar, os Curadores podem decidir entre sinalizar numa vers√£o espec√≠fica do subgraph ou sinalizar com a automigra√ß√£o. Caso sinalizem com a automigra√ß√£o, as a√ß√µes de um curador sempre ser√£o atualizadas √† vers√£o mais recente publicada pelo programador. Se decidirem sinalizar numa vers√£o espec√≠fica, as a√ß√µes sempre permanecer√£o naquela vers√£o espec√≠fica.

Para ajudar equipas que transitam subgraphs do servi√ßo hospedado √† Graph Network, abrimos o suporte para curadoria. Se precisar de ajuda com curadoria para melhorar a qualidade do servi√ßo, contacte a equipa da Edge & Node em support@thegraph.zendesk.com e especifique os subgraphs com os quais precisa de ajuda.

Quando o seu subgraph alcan√ßar um sinal de curadoria adequado e outros Indexadores come√ßarem a apoi√°-lo, o Indexador de atualiza√ß√£o se estabilizar√° gradualmente, de modo a permitir que outros Indexadores coletem recompensas de indexa√ß√£o e taxas de query.

### Devo hospedar a minha pr√≥pria infraestrutura de indexa√ß√£o?

A execu√ß√£o de infraestrutura para o seu pr√≥prio projeto [requer muito mais recursos](/network/benefits/) em compara√ß√£o ao uso da Graph Network.

Al√©m disto, a Graph Network √© muito mais robusta, confi√°vel, com um custo-benef√≠cio muito melhor comparado a qualquer coisa fornecida por uma √∫nica organiza√ß√£o ou equipa. Centenas de Indexadores independentes ao redor do mundo operam a Graph Network para garantir seguran√ßa e redund√¢ncia.

Dito isto, se ainda tiver interesse em executar um [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node), considere entrar na Graph Network [como Indexador](https://thegraph.com/blog/how-to-become-indexer/) para ganhar recompensas de indexa√ß√£o e taxas de query ao servir dados no seu subgraph e em outros.

### Devo usar um provedor de indexa√ß√£o centralizado?

Se construir na web3, a partir do momento que usa um provedor de indexa√ß√£o centralizado, voc√™ d√°-os controle do seu dApp e dos seus dados. A rede descentralizada do The Graph oferece [uma qualidade melhor de servi√ßo](https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/), confian√ßa com atividade imbat√≠vel gra√ßas √† redund√¢ncia de nodes, al√©m de [custos muito menores](/network/benefits/); e voc√™ n√£o ser√° feito de ref√©m na camada de dados.

Com a Graph Network, o seu subgraph √© p√∫blico e qualquer pessoa pode enviar queries a ele abertamente, o que aumenta o uso e os efeitos na rede do seu dApp.

Al√©m disto, o Subgraph Studio fornece 100 mil queries mensais gratuitas no Plano Gr√°tis antes da necessidade de pagar para mais uso.

Aqui est√° um resumo detalhado dos benef√≠cios do The Graph em compara√ß√£o √† hospedagem centralizada:

- **Resili√™ncia e Redund√¢ncia**: Sistemas descentralizados, por natureza, s√£o mais robustos e resilientes devido √† sua natureza distribu√≠da. Os dados n√£o s√£o guardados num √∫nico servidor ou local, mas sim, servidos por centenas de Indexadores independentes ao redor do mundo. Isto reduz o risco de perda de dados ou interrup√ß√µes do servi√ßo se um node falhar, o que leva a um tempo de atividade excepcional (99,99%).

- **Qualidade de Servi√ßo**: Al√©m do tempo de atividade impressionante, a Graph Network tem uma velocidade de query mediana (lat√™ncia) de cerca de 106ms, e √≠ndices maiores de sucesso de query em compara√ß√£o a alternativas hospedadas. Leia mais [neste blog](https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/).

- **Resist√™ncia a Censura**: Sistemas centralizados s√£o alvos f√°ceis para censura, seja por press√£o regulat√≥ria ou ataques √† rede. As arquiteturas dispersadas de sistemas descentralizados os faz muito mais dif√≠ceis de censurar, o que garante a disponibilidade cont√≠nua dos dados.

- **Transpar√™ncia e Confian√ßa**: Sistemas descentralizados operam de forma aberta, o que permite que qualquer pessoa verifique os dados de forma independente. Esta transpar√™ncia constr√≥i confian√ßa entre participantes da rede, j√° que podem verificar a integridade do sistema sem depender de uma autoridade central.

Assim como voc√™ escolheu a sua rede de blockchain pela natureza descentralizada, seguran√ßa e transpar√™ncia, optar pela Graph Network √© uma extens√£o destes mesmos princ√≠pios. Ao alinhar a sua infraestrutura de dados com estes valores, voc√™ garante um ambiente de programa√ß√£o coeso, resiliente e cheio de confian√ßa.
