title: Deprecate a Subgraph
---

Although you cannot delete a subgraph, you can deprecate it on Graph Explorer.

## Step-by-Step

To deprecate your subgraph, do the following:

1. Visit the contract address for Arbitrum One subgraphs [here](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xec9A7fb6CbC2E41926127929c2dcE6e9c5D33Bec#writeProxyContract).
2. Call `deprecateSubgraph` with your `SubgraphID` as your argument.
3. Your subgraph will no longer appear in searches on Graph Explorer.

## Reminders

- The owner's wallet should call the `deprecateSubgraph` function.
- Кураторы больше не смогут сигналить на сабграф.
- Curators that already signaled on the subgraph can withdraw their signal at an average share price.
- Deprecated subgraphs will show an error message.

> If you interacted with the deprecated subgraph, you can find it in your user profile under the "Subgraphs", "Indexing", or "Curating" tab, respectively.
