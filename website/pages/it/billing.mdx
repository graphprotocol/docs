> Invoices are generated on a weekly basis.

There are two options for paying for your query fees:

- [Paying with fiat currency with Banxa](#billing-with-banxa)
- [Paying with crypto wallet](#billing-on-arbitrum)

## Billing with Banxa

Banxa enables you to bypass the need for an exchange and pay for your query fees using the fiat currency of your choice. The fiat currency will be converted to GRT, added to your account balance on the billing contract, and used to pay for queries associated with your API keys.

There may be KYC requirements depending on the regulations in your country. For more information about KYC, please visit [Banxa's FAQ page](https://docs.banxa.com/docs/faqs).

You can learn more about Banxa by reading their [documentation](https://docs.banxa.com/docs).

### Paying for query fees with Banxa

1. Select “Pay with Card” option in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/billing/?show=Deposit).
2. Enter the amount of GRT to be added to your account balance.
3. Click the 'Continue with Banxa' button.
4. Enter necessary banking information on Banxa including payment method & fiat currency of choice.
5. Finish the transaction.

It may take up to 10 minutes to complete the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, the purchased GRT will automatically be added to your account balance on Arbitrum.

## Billing on Arbitrum

While The Graph protocol operates on Ethereum Mainnet, [the billing contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1b07d3344188908fb6deceac381f3ee63c48477a) lives on the [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) network to reduce transaction times and cost. You'll be required to pay the query fees generated from your API keys. Using the billing contract, you'll be able to:

- Add and withdraw GRT from your account balance.
- Keep track of your balances based on how much GRT you have added to your account balance, how much you have removed, and your invoices.
- Automatically pay invoices based on query fees generated, as long as there is enough GRT in your account balance.
