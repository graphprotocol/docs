The hosted service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints.

Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are being deprecated. Read more on the [Ethereum Foundation Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/06/21/testnet-deprecation). As of Feb 25th 2023, Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are no longer supported by the hosted service. Goerli will be maintained by client developers post-merge, and is also supported by the hosted service. Developers who currently use Ropsten, Rinkeby or Kovan as their staging/testing environment are encouraged to migrate to Goerli.

Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier. `xdai` is still supported for existing hosted service subgraphs.

For a full list of which features are supported on the decentralized network, see [this page](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md).

Substreams-powered subgraphs indexing `mainnet` Ethereum are supported on the Subgraph Studio and decentralized network.

## Graph Node

If your preferred network isn't supported on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph Node can also index other protocols, via a Firehose integration. Firehose integrations have been created for NEAR, Arweave and Cosmos-based networks.
