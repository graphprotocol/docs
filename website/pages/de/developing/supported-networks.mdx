## The Graph's Decentralized Network

The following networks are supported on The Graph's Decentralized Network:

- `mainnet` (Ethereum)
- `gnosis`\*
- `celo`\*
- `avalanche`\*
- `arbitrum-one`\*

\*In beta.

## Hosted Service

> The hosted service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints.

The following networks are supported in beta on the Hosted Service:

- `goerli`
- `poa-core`
- `poa-sokol`
- `matic` (now known as Polygon)
- `mumbai`
- `fantom`
- `fantom-testnet`
- `bsc` (now known as BNB Chain)
- `chapel`
- `clover`
- `fuji`
- `fuse`
- `moonriver`
- `moonbeam`
- `mbase`
- `optimism`
- `optimism-goerli`
- `aurora`
- `aurora-testnet`
- `boba`
- `harmony`
- `zkSync2-testnet`
- `osmosis-1`
- `base-testnet`

### Near

- `near-mainnet`
- `near-testnet`

### Cosmos

- `cosmoshub-4`
- `theta-testnet-001` (this is the current Cosmos Hub testnet)

### Arweave

- `arweave-mainnet`

You will **not be able** to publish a subgraph that indexes a non-mainnet network to the decentralized Graph Network in [Subgraph Studio](/deploying/subgraph-studio).

Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are being deprecated. Read more on the [Ethereum Foundation Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/06/21/testnet-deprecation). As of Feb 25th 2023, Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are no longer supported by the Hosted Service. Goerli will be maintained by client developers post-merge, and is also supported by the Hosted Service. Developers who currently use Ropsten, Rinkeby or Kovan as their staging/testing environment are encouraged to migrate to Goerli.

Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier. `xdai` is still supported for existing hosted service subgraphs.

## Graph Node

If your preferred network isn't support on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own Graph Node to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph Node can also index other protocols, via a Firehose integration. Firehose integrations have been created for NEAR, Arweave and Cosmos-based networks.
