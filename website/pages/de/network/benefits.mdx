The Graph’s decentralized network has been engineered and refined to create a robust indexing and querying experience—and it’s getting better every day thanks to thousands of contributors around the world.

The benefits of this decentralized protocol cannot be replicated by running a `graph-node` locally. The Graph Network is more reliable, more efficient, and less expensive.

Here is an analysis:

## Why You Should Use The Graph Network

- 60-98% lower monthly cost
- $0 infrastructure setup costs
- Superior uptime
- Access to 438 Indexers (and counting)
- 24/7 technical support by global community

## The Benefits Explained

### Lower & more Flexible Cost Structure

No contracts. No monthly fees. Only pay for the queries you use—with an average cost-per-query of $0.0002. Queries are priced in USD and paid in GRT.

Query costs may vary; the quoted cost is the average at time of publication (December 2022).

\*including costs for backup: $50-$100 per month

Estimated costs are only for Ethereum Mainnet subgraphs — costs are even higher when self hosting a `graph-node` on other networks.

Curating signal on a subgraph is an optional one-time, net-zero cost (e.g., $1k in signal can be curated on a subgraph, and later withdrawn—with potential to earn returns in the process).

Some users may need to update their subgraph to a new version. Due to Ethereum gas fees, an update costs ~$50 at time of writing.

Note that gas fees on [Arbitrum](/arbitrum/arbitrum-faq) are substantially lower than Ethereum mainnet.

## No Setup Costs & Greater Operational Efficiency

Zero setup fees. Get started immediately with no setup or overhead costs. No hardware requirements. No outages due to centralized infrastructure, and more time to concentrate on your core product . No need for backup servers, troubleshooting, or expensive engineering resources.

## Reliability & Resiliency

The Graph’s decentralized network gives users access to geographic redundancy that does not exist when self-hosting a `graph-node`. Queries are served reliably thanks to 99.9%+ uptime, achieved by 168 Indexers (and counting) securing the network globally.

Bottom line: The Graph Network is less expensive, easier to use, and produces superior results compared to running a `graph-node` locally.
