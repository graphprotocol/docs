title: What is the Hosted Service?
---

> Please note, hosted service endpoints will no longer be available after June 12th 2024 as all subgraphs will need to upgrade to The Graph Network. Please read more in the [Sunrise FAQ](/sunrise)

This section will walk you through deploying a subgraph to the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/).

If you don't have an account on the hosted service, you can sign up with your GitHub account. Once you authenticate, you can start creating subgraphs through the UI and deploying them from your terminal. The hosted service supports a number of networks, such as Polygon, Gnosis Chain, BNB Chain, Optimism, Arbitrum, and more.

For a comprehensive list, see [Supported Networks](/developing/supported-networks/#hosted-service).

## Create a Subgraph

First follow the instructions [here](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#install-the-graph-cli) to install the Graph CLI. Create a subgraph by passing in `graph init --product hosted-service`

### From an Existing Contract

If you already have a smart contract deployed to your network of choice, bootstrapping a new subgraph from this contract can be a good way to get started on the hosted service.

You can use this command to create a subgraph that indexes all events from an existing contract. This will attempt to fetch the contract ABI from the block explorer.

```sh
graph init \
  --product hosted-service
  --from-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> [<DIRECTORY>]
```

Additionally, you can use the following optional arguments. If the ABI cannot be fetched from the block explorer, it falls back to requesting a local file path. If any optional arguments are missing from the command, it takes you through an interactive form.

```sh
--network <ETHEREUM_NETWORK> \
--abi <FILE> \
```

The `<GITHUB_USER>` in this case is your GitHub user or organization name, `<SUBGRAPH_NAME>` is the name for your subgraph, and `<DIRECTORY>` is the optional name of the directory where `graph init` will put the example subgraph manifest. The `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` is the address of your existing contract. `<ETHEREUM_NETWORK>` is the name of the network that the contract lives on. `<FILE>` is a local path to a contract ABI file. **Both `--network` and `--abi` are optional.**

### From an Example Subgraph

The second mode `graph init` supports is creating a new project from an example subgraph. The following command does this:

```
graph init --from-example --product hosted-service <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> [<DIRECTORY>]
```

The example subgraph is based on the Gravity contract by Dani Grant that manages user avatars and emits `NewGravatar` or `UpdateGravatar` events whenever avatars are created or updated. The subgraph handles these events by writing `Gravatar` entities to the Graph Node store and ensuring these are updated according to the events. Continue on to the [subgraph manifest](/developing/creating-a-subgraph#the-subgraph-manifest) to better understand which events from your smart contracts to pay attention to, mappings, and more.

### From a Proxy Contract

To build a subgraph tailored for monitoring a Proxy contract, initialize the subgraph by specifying the address of the implementation contract. Once the initialization process is concluded, the last step involves updating the network name in the subgraph.yaml file to the address of the Proxy contract. You can use the command below.

```sh
graph init \
  --product hosted-service
  --from-contract <IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS> \
  <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> [<DIRECTORY>]
```

## Supported Networks on the hosted service

You can find the list of the supported networks [here](/developing/supported-networks).
