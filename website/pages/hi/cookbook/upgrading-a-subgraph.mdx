title: Upgrading an Existing Subgraph to The Graph Network
---

## परिचय

This is a guide on how to upgrade your subgraph from the hosted service to The Graph's decentralized network. Over 1,000 subgraphs have successfully upgraded to The Graph Network including projects like Snapshot, Loopring, Audius, Premia, Livepeer, Uma, Curve, Lido, and many more!

The process of upgrading is quick and your subgraphs will forever benefit from the reliability and performance that you can only get on The Graph Network.

### आवश्यक शर्तें

- You have a subgraph deployed on the hosted service.

## Upgrading an Existing Subgraph to The Graph Network

<VideoEmbed youtube="hCmX5Dlhdjw" />

If you are logged in to the hosted service, you can access a simple flow to upgrade your subgraphs from [your dashboard](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard), or from an individual subgraph page.

> This process typically takes less than five minutes.

1. Select the subgraph(s) you want to upgrade.
2. Connect or enter the receiving wallet (the wallet that will become the owner of the subgraph).
3. Click the "Upgrade" button.

That's it! Your subgraphs will be deployed to Subgraph Studio, and published on The Graph Network. You can access the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to manage your subgraphs, logging in with the wallet specified during the upgrade process.

You'll be able to view your subgraphs live on the decentralized network via [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer).

### What next?

When your subgraph is upgraded, it will automatically be indexed by the upgrade indexer. If the indexed chain is [fully supported by The Graph Network](/developing/supported-networks), you can add some GRT as "signal", to attract more indexers. It is recommended to curate your subgraph with at least 3,000 GRT to attract 2-3 Indexers for higher quality of service.

You can start to query your subgraph right away on The Graph Network, once you have generated an API key.

### एक एपीआई key बनाएँ

You can generate an API key in Subgraph Studio [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).

![API key creation page](/img/api-image.png)

You can use this API key to query subgraphs on The Graph Network. All users start on the Free Plan, which includes 100,000 free queries per month. Developers can sign up for the Growth Plan by connecting a credit or debit card, or by depositing GRT to Subgraph Studio billing system.

> Note: see the [billing documentation](../billing) for more information on plans, and on managing your billing on Subgraph Studio.

### अपनी एपीआई key सुरक्षित करना

यह अनुशंसा की जाती है कि आप एपीआई के उपयोग को दो तरीकों से सीमित करके सुरक्षित करें:

1. अधिकृत सबग्राफ
2. अधिकृत डोमेन

You can secure your API key [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).

### विकेंद्रीकृत नेटवर्क पर अपने सबग्राफ को क्वेरी करना

Now you can check the indexing status of the Indexers on the network in Graph Explorer (example [here](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/Dtj2HicXKpoUjNB7ffdBkMwt3L9Sz3cbENd67AdHu6Vb?view=Indexers&chain=arbitrum-one)). The green line at the top indicates that at the time of posting 7 Indexers successfully indexed that subgraph. Also in the Indexer tab you can see which Indexers picked up your subgraph.

![Rocket Pool subgraph](/img/rocket-pool-subgraph.png)

जैसे ही पहले इंडेक्सर ने आपके सबग्राफ को पूरी तरह से इंडेक्स कर लिया, आप सबग्राफ को विकेंद्रीकृत नेटवर्क पर क्वेरी करना शुरू कर सकते हैं। अपने सबग्राफ के लिए क्वेरी URL को पुनः प्राप्त करने के लिए, आप क्वेरी URL के बगल में स्थित प्रतीक पर क्लिक करके इसे कॉपी/पेस्ट कर सकते हैं। आपको कुछ ऐसा दिखाई देगा:

`https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/S9ihna8D733WTEShJ1KctSTCvY1VJ7gdVwhUujq4Ejo`

Important: Make sure to replace `[api-key]` with an actual API key generated in the section above.

अब आप अपने ग्राफ़िकल अनुरोधों को भेजने के लिए अपने डैप में उस क्वेरी URL का उपयोग कर सकते हैं।

बधाई हो! अब आप विकेंद्रीकरण के अग्रणी हैं!

> Note: Due to the distributed nature of the network it might be the case that different Indexers have indexed up to different blocks. In order to only receive fresh data you can specify the minimum block an Indexer has to have indexed in order to serve your query with the block: `{ number_gte: $minBlock }` field argument as shown in the example below:

```graphql
{
  stakers(block: { number_gte: 14486109 }) {
    id
  }
}
```

More information about the nature of the network and how to handle re-orgs are described in the documentation article [Distributed Systems](/querying/distributed-systems/).

## Updating a Subgraph on the Network

If you would like to update an existing subgraph on the network, you can do this by deploying a new version of your subgraph to Subgraph Studio using the Graph CLI.

1. Make changes to your current subgraph.
2. निम्नलिखित को तैनात करें और कमांड में नया संस्करण निर्दिष्ट करें (जैसे। v0.0.1, v0.0.2, आदि):

```sh
graph deploy --studio --version <version> <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

3. Test the new version in Subgraph Studio by querying in the playground
4. ग्राफ़ नेटवर्क पर नया संस्करण प्रकाशित करें। याद रखें कि इसके लिए गैस की आवश्यकता होती है (जैसा कि ऊपर अनुभाग में बताया गया है)।

### Owner Update Fee: Deep Dive

> Note: Curation on Arbitrum has a flat bonding curve. Learn more about Arbitrum [here](/arbitrum/arbitrum-faq/).

An update requires GRT to be migrated from the old version of the subgraph to the new version. This means that for every update, a new bonding curve will be created (more on bonding curves [here](/network/curating#bonding-curve-101)).

The new bonding curve charges the 1% curation tax on all GRT being migrated to the new version. The owner must pay 50% of this or 1.25%. The other 1.25% is absorbed by all the curators as a fee. This incentive design is in place to prevent an owner of a subgraph from being able to drain all their curator's funds with recursive update calls. If there is no curation activity, you will have to pay a minimum of 100 GRT in order to signal your own subgraph.

आइए एक उदाहरण बनाते हैं, यह केवल तभी होता है जब आपका सबग्राफ सक्रिय रूप से क्यूरेट किया जा रहा हो:

- एक सबग्राफ के v1 पर ऑटो-माइग्रेट का उपयोग करके 100,000 GRT का संकेत दिया जाता है
- Owner updates to v2. 100,000 GRT is migrated to a new bonding curve, where 97,500 GRT get put into the new curve and 2,500 GRT is burned
- The owner then has 1250 GRT burned to pay for half the fee. The owner must have this in their wallet before the update, otherwise, the update will not succeed. This happens in the same transaction as the update.

_While this mechanism is currently live on the network, the community is currently discussing ways to reduce the cost of updates for subgraph developers._

### एक सबग्राफ का एक स्थिर संस्करण बनाए रखना

If you're making a lot of changes to your subgraph, it is not a good idea to continually update it and front the update costs. Maintaining a stable and consistent version of your subgraph is critical, not only from the cost perspective but also so that Indexers can feel confident in their syncing times. Indexers should be flagged when you plan for an update so that Indexer syncing times do not get impacted. Feel free to leverage the [#Indexers channel](https://discord.gg/JexvtHa7dq) on Discord to let Indexers know when you're versioning your subgraphs.

Subgraphs are open APIs that external developers are leveraging. Open APIs need to follow strict standards so that they do not break external developers' applications. In The Graph Network, a subgraph developer must consider Indexers and how long it takes them to sync a new subgraph **as well as** other developers who are using their subgraphs.

### सबग्राफ के मेटाडेटा को अपडेट करना

You can update the metadata of your subgraphs without having to publish a new version. The metadata includes the subgraph name, image, description, website URL, source code URL, and categories. Developers can do this by updating their subgraph details in Subgraph Studio where you can edit all applicable fields.

Make sure **Update Subgraph Details in Explorer** is checked and click on **Save**. If this is checked, an on-chain transaction will be generated that updates subgraph details in the Explorer without having to publish a new version with a new deployment.

## ग्राफ़ नेटवर्क में एक सबग्राफ को तैनात करने के लिए सर्वोत्तम अभ्यास

1. सबग्राफ डेवलपमेंट के लिए ENS नाम का लाभ उठाना:

- Set up your ENS [here](https://app.ens.domains/)
- Add your ENS name to your settings [here](https://thegraph.com/explorer/settings?view=display-name).

2. आपके प्रोफाइल जितने अधिक भरे हुए हैं, आपके सबग्राफ के अनुक्रमित और क्यूरेट होने की संभावना उतनी ही बेहतर है।

## ग्राफ़ नेटवर्क पर एक सबग्राफ का बहिष्कार करना

Follow the steps [here](/managing/deprecating-a-subgraph) to deprecate your subgraph and remove it from The Graph Network.

## ग्राफ़ नेटवर्क पर एक सबग्राफ + बिलिंग को क्वेरी करना

The hosted service was set up to allow developers to deploy their subgraphs without any restrictions.

On The Graph Network, query fees have to be paid as a core part of the protocol's incentives. For more information on subscribing to APIs and paying the query fees, check out billing documentation [here](/billing/).
