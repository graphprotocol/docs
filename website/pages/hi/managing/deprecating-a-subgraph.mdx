title: Deprecating a Subgraph
---

So you'd like to deprecate your subgraph on The Graph Explorer. You've come to the right place! Follow the steps below:

1. Visit the contract address [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xadca0dd4729c8ba3acf3e99f3a9f471ef37b6825#writeProxyContract)
2. Call `deprecateSubgraph` with your `SubgraphID` as your argument.
3. Voilà! Your subgraph will no longer show up on searches on The Graph Explorer.

Please note the following:

- The `deprecateSubgraph` function should be called by the owner's wallet.
- Curators will not be able to signal on the subgraph anymore.
- Curators that already signaled on the subgraph will be able to withdraw their signal at an average share price.
- Deprecated subgraphs will be indicated with an error message.
