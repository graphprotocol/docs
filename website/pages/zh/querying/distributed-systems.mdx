title: 分布式系统
---

The Graph is a protocol implemented as a distributed system.

Connections fail. Requests arrive out of order. Different computers with out-of-sync clocks and states process related requests. Servers restart. Re-orgs happen between requests. These problems are inherent to all distributed systems but are exacerbated in systems operating at a global scale.

Consider this example of what may occur if a client polls an Indexer for the latest data during a re-org.

1. Indexer ingests block 8
2. 区块 8 的数据传送给客户端
3. Indexer ingests block 9
4. Indexer ingests block 10A
5. 区块 10A 的数据传送给客户端
6. Indexer detects reorg to 10B and rolls back 10A
7. 区块 9 的数据传送给客户端
8. Indexer ingests block 10B
9. Indexer ingests block 11
10. 区块 11 的数据传送给客户端

From the point of view of the Indexer, things are progressing forward logically. Time is moving forward, though we did have to roll back an uncle block and play the block under consensus forward on top of it. Along the way, the Indexer serves requests using the latest state it knows about at that time.

From the point of view of the client, however, things appear chaotic. The client observes that the responses were for blocks 8, 10, 9, and 11 in that order. We call this the "block wobble" problem. When a client experiences block wobble, data may appear to contradict itself over time. The situation worsens when we consider that Indexers do not all ingest the latest blocks simultaneously, and your requests may be routed to multiple Indexers.

客户端和服务器有责任协同工作，以便向用户提供一致的数据。 根据所需的一致性目标的不同，我们必须使用不同的方法，因为没有一个适合所有问题的完美解决方案。

Reasoning through the implications of distributed systems is hard, but the fix may not be! We've established APIs and patterns to help you navigate some common use-cases. The following examples illustrate those patterns but still elide details required by production code (like error handling and cancellation) to not obfuscate the main ideas.

## 轮询更新的数据

The Graph provides the `block: { number_gte: $minBlock }` API, which ensures that the response is for a single block equal or higher to `$minBlock`. If the request is made to a `graph-node` instance and the min block is not yet synced, `graph-node` will return an error. If `graph-node` has synced min block, it will run the response for the latest block. If the request is made to an Edge & Node Gateway, the Gateway will filter out any Indexers that have not yet synced min block and make the request for the latest block the Indexer has synced.

我们可以使用 `number_gte`， 从而确保在循环中轮询数据时，时间不会倒流。 这是一个例子：

```javascript
/// Updates the protocol.paused variable to the latest
/// known value in a loop by fetching it using The Graph.
async function updateProtocolPaused() {
  // It's ok to start with minBlock at 0. The query will be served
  // using the latest block available. Setting minBlock to 0 is the
  // same as leaving out that argument.
  let minBlock = 0

  for (;;) {
    // Schedule a promise that will be ready once
    // the next Ethereum block will likely be available.
    const nextBlock = new Promise((f) => {
      setTimeout(f, 14000)
    })

    const query = `
        query GetProtocol($minBlock: Int!) {
            protocol(block: { number_gte: $minBlock }  id: "0") {
              paused
            }
            _meta {
                block {
                    number
                }
            }
        }`

    const variables = { minBlock }
    const response = await graphql(query, variables)
    minBlock = response._meta.block.number

    // TODO: Do something with the response data here instead of logging it.
    console.log(response.protocol.paused)

    // Sleep to wait for the next block
    await nextBlock
  }
}
```

## 获取一组相关项目

另一个用例是检索一个更大的集合，或者更一般地说，跨多个请求检索相关项目。 与轮询案例（所需的一致性是及时向前进行）不同，此用例所需的一致性是针对单个时间点的。

在这里，我们将使用 `block: { hash: $blockHash }` 参数将我们所有的结果锚定到同一个区块。

```javascript
/// Gets a list of domain names from a single block using pagination
async function getDomainNames() {
  // Set a cap on the maximum number of items to pull.
  let pages = 5
  const perPage = 1000

  // The first query will get the first page of results and also get the block
  // hash so that the remainder of the queries are consistent with the first.
  const listDomainsQuery = `
    query ListDomains($perPage: Int!) {
        domains(first: $perPage) {
            name
            id
        }
        _meta {
            block {
                hash
            }
        }
    }`

  let data = await graphql(listDomainsQuery, { perPage })
  let result = data.domains.map((d) => d.name)
  let blockHash = data._meta.block.hash

  let query
  // Continue fetching additional pages until either we run into the limit of
  // 5 pages total (specified above) or we know we have reached the last page
  // because the page has fewer entities than a full page.
  while (data.domains.length == perPage && --pages) {
    let lastID = data.domains[data.domains.length - 1].id
    query = `
        query ListDomains($perPage: Int!, $lastID: ID!, $blockHash: Bytes!) {
            domains(first: $perPage, where: { id_gt: $lastID }, block: { hash: $blockHash }) {
                name
                id
            }
        }`

    data = await graphql(query, { perPage, lastID, blockHash })

    // Accumulate domain names into the result
    for (domain of data.domains) {
      result.push(domain.name)
    }
  }
  return result
}
```

Note that in case of a re-org, the client will need to retry from the first request to update the block hash to a non-uncle block.
