title: Querying The Graph
---

With the subgraph deployed, visit the [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer) to open up a [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) interface where you can explore the deployed GraphQL API for the subgraph by issuing queries and viewing the schema.

下面提供了一个示例，但请参阅 [查询 API](/querying/graphql-api) 以获取有关如何查询子图实体的完整参考。

#### 示例

This query lists all the counters our mapping has created. Since we only create one, the result will only contain our one `default-counter`:

```graphql
{
  counters {
    id
    value
  }
}
```

## 使用 Graph 浏览器

每个发布到去中心化 Graph 浏览器的子图都有一个独特的查询 URL，你可以通过导航到子图的详细信息页面并点击右上角的 "查询 "按钮找到。这将打开一个侧窗格，给你提供该子图的唯一查询 URL，以及一些关于如何查询的说明。

As you can notice, this query URL must use a unique API key. You can create and manage your API keys in the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio) in the "API Keys" section. Learn more about how to use Subgraph Studio [here](/deploying/subgraph-studio).

Querying subgraphs using your API keys will generate query fees that will be paid in GRT. You can learn more about billing [here](/billing).

You can also use the GraphQL playground in the "Playground" tab to query a subgraph within The Graph Explorer.
