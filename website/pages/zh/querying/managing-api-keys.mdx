title: Managing your API keys
---

Regardless of whether you’re a dapp developer or a subgraph developer, you’ll need to manage your API keys. This is important for you to be able to query subgraphs because API keys make sure the connections between application services are valid and authorized. This includes authenticating the end user and the device using the application.

The Studio will list out existing API keys, which will give you the ability to manage or delete them.

1. **概述**部分将允许您：
   - 编辑您的密钥名称
   - 重新生成 API 密钥
   - 使用统计信息查看 API 密钥的当前使用情况：
     - 查询数
     - 花费的 GRT 金额
2. Under **Security**, you’ll be able to opt into security settings depending on the level of control you’d like to have over your API keys. In this section, you can:
   - 查看和管理授权使用您的 API 密钥的域名
   - 分配可以使用您的 API 密钥查询的子图
3. Under **Indexer Preference**, you’ll be able to set different preferences for Indexers who are indexing subgraphs that your API key is used for. You can assign up to 5 points for each of these:
   - **Fastest Speed**: Time between the query and the response from an indexer. If you mark this as important we will optimize for fast indexers.
   - **Lowest Price**: The amount paid per query. If you mark this as important we will optimize for the less expensive indexers.
   - **Data Freshness**: How recent the latest block an indexer has processed for the subgraph you are querying. If you mark this as important we will optimize to find the indexers with the freshest data.
   - **Economic Security**: The amount of GRT an indexer can lose if they respond incorrectly to your query. If you mark this as important we will optimize for indexers with a large stake.
4. Under **Budget**, you’ll be able to update the maximum price per query. Note that we have a dynamic setting for that that's based on a volume discounting algorithm. **We strongly recommend using the default settings unless you are experiencing a specific problem.** Otherwise, you can update it under "Set a custom maximum budget". On this page you can also view different KPIs (in GRT and USD):
   - Average cost per query
   - Failed queries over max price
   - 最昂贵的查询
