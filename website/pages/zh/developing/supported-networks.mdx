\* Preliminary network support via the [upgrade Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/upgrade-indexer/)  
&#8288;<sup>†</sup> Supports Substreams

The hosted service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints.

Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier. `xdai` is still supported for existing hosted service subgraphs.

有关去中心化网络支持哪些功能的完整列表，请参阅[本页](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md)。

Substreams-powered subgraphs indexing `mainnet` Ethereum are supported in Subgraph Studio and on the decentralized network.

## Graph 节点

If your preferred network isn't supported on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph节点 还可以通过 Firehose 集成对其他协议进行索引。Firehose集成已创建的 NEAR，Arweave 和基于Cosmos的链。
