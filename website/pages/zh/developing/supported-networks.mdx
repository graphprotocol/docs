\* Preliminary network support via the [upgrade Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/upgrade-indexer/)  
&#8288;<sup>†</sup> Supports Substreams

The hosted service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints.

Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are being deprecated. Read more on the [Ethereum Foundation Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/06/21/testnet-deprecation). As of Feb 25th 2023, Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are no longer supported by the hosted service. Goerli will be maintained by client developers post-merge, and is also supported by the hosted service. Developers who currently use Ropsten, Rinkeby or Kovan as their staging/testing environment are encouraged to migrate to Goerli.

Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier. `xdai` is still supported for existing hosted service subgraphs.

Substreams-支持的子图索引 `主网` 子图工作室以及分布式网络上都支持以太坊.

## Graph 节点

If your preferred network isn't supported on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph节点 还可以通过 Firehose 集成对其他协议进行索引。Firehose集成已创建的 NEAR，Arweave 和基于Cosmos的链。
