title: Upgrading an Existing Subgraph to The Graph Network
---

## 介绍

This is a guide on how to upgrade your subgraph from the hosted service to The Graph's decentralized network. Over 1,000 subgraphs have successfully upgraded to The Graph Network including projects like Snapshot, Loopring, Audius, Premia, Livepeer, Uma, Curve, Lido, and many more!

The process of upgrading is quick and your subgraphs will forever benefit from the reliability and performance that you can only get on The Graph Network.

### 先决条件

-   您已经在托管服务上部署了子图。
-   该子图正在索引Graph网络上支持的链(或测试版中支持的链)。
-   You have a wallet with ETH to publish your subgraph on-chain.
-   You have ~10,000 GRT to curate your subgraph so Indexers can begin indexing it.

## Upgrading an Existing Subgraph to The Graph Network

> You can find specific commands for your subgraph in the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

1.  获取已安装的最新版本的 graph-cli：

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

```sh
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

Make sure your `apiVersion` in subgraph.yaml is `0.0.5` or greater.

2.  在子图的主项目存储库中，对子图进行身份验证，以便在studio上部署和构建:

```sh
graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
```

3.  生成文件并构建子图：

```sh
graph codegen && graph build
```

If your subgraph has build errors, refer to the [AssemblyScript Migration Guide](/release-notes/assemblyscript-migration-guide/).

4.  Sign into [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) with your wallet and deploy the subgraph. You can find your `<SUBGRAPH_SLUG>` in the Studio UI, which is based on the name of your subgraph.

```sh
graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

5.  Test queries on the Studio's playground. Here are some examples for the [Sushi - Mainnet Exchange Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph?id=0x4bb4c1b0745ef7b4642feeccd0740dec417ca0a0-0&view=Playground):

```sh
{
  users(first: 5) {
    id
    liquidityPositions {
      id
    }
  }
  bundles(first: 5) {
    id
    ethPrice
  }
}
```

6.  此时，您的子图现在已经部署在Subgraph Studio上，但还没有发布到去中心化网络上。现在，您可以使用上面右列顶部的临时查询URL来测试子图，以确保它正常工作。正如这个名称已经表明的那样，这是一个临时URL，不应该在生产环境中使用。

-   Updating is just publishing another version of your existing subgraph on-chain.
-   Because this incurs a cost, it is highly recommended to deploy and test your subgraph in the Subgraph Studio, using the "Development Query URL" before publishing. See an example transaction [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0c3fa0bc035703c9ba1ce40c1862559b9c5b6ea1198b3320871d535aa0de87b). Prices are roughly around 0.0425 ETH at 100 gwei.
-   Any time you need to update your subgraph, you will be charged an update fee. Because this incurs a cost, it is highly recommended to deploy and test your subgraph on Goerli before deploying to mainnet. It can, in some cases, also require some GRT if there is no signal on that subgraph. In the case there is signal/curation on that subgraph version (using auto-migrate), the taxes will be split.

7.  通过点击“发布”按钮在Graph的去中心化网络上发布子图。

You should curate your subgraph with GRT to ensure that it is indexed by Indexers. To save on gas costs, you can curate your subgraph in the same transaction that you publish it to the network. It is recommended to curate your subgraph with at least 10,000 GRT for high quality of service.

And that's it! After you are done publishing, you'll be able to view your subgraphs live on the decentralized network via [The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer).

Feel free to leverage the [#Curators channel](https://discord.gg/rC8rBuRtbH) on Discord to let Curators know that your subgraph is ready to be signaled. It would also be helpful if you share your expected query volume with them. Therefore, they can estimate how much GRT they should signal on your subgraph.

### 创建一个API密钥

You can generate an API key in Subgraph Studio [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).

![API key creation page](/img/api-image.png)

在每周结束时，将根据在此期间发生的查询费用生成发票。此发票将自动使用您的余额中的GRT支付。您的查询费用的成本被撤回后，您的余额将被更新。查询费用通过Arbitrum网络以GRT支付。您需要将GRT添加到Arbitrum计费合同中，通过以下步骤启用您的API密钥:

-   在你选择的交换机上购买GRT。
-   把GRT送到你的钱包里。
-   在Studio中的Billing page上，单击Add GRT。

![Add GRT in billing](/img/Add-GRT-New-Page.png)

-   按照以下步骤将GRT添加到您的账单余额中。
-   您的GRT将自动连接到Arbitrum网络并添加到您的账单余额。

![Billing pane](/img/New-Billing-Pane.png)

> Note: see the [official billing page](../billing.mdx) for full instructions on adding GRT to your billing balance.

### 保护您的API密钥

建议您通过以下两种限制API使用的方式来保护API：

1.  授权子图
2.  授权域名

You can secure your API key [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/test/).

![Subgraph lockdown page](/img/subgraph-lockdown.png)

### 在去中心化网络上查询子图

Now you can check the indexing status of the Indexers on the network in Graph Explorer (example [here](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph?id=S9ihna8D733WTEShJ1KctSTCvY1VJ7gdVwhUujq4Ejo&view=Indexers)). The green line at the top indicates that at the time of posting 8 Indexers successfully indexed that subgraph. Also in the Indexer tab you can see which Indexers picked up your subgraph.

![Rocket Pool subgraph](/img/rocket-pool-subgraph.png)

一旦第一个索引人完全索引了您的子图，您就可以开始在去中心化的网络上查询子图。为了检索子图的查询URL，您可以通过单击查询URL旁边的符号来复制/粘贴它。你会看到这样的东西:

`https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/S9ihna8D733WTEShJ1KctSTCvY1VJ7gdVwhUujq4Ejo`

Important: Make sure to replace `[api-key]` with an actual API key generated in the section above.

现在可以在dapp中使用该查询URL发送GraphQL请求。

恭喜! 你现在是去中心化的先驱了！

> Note: Due to the distributed nature of the network it might be the case that different Indexers have indexed up to different blocks. In order to only receive fresh data you can specify the minimum block an Indexer has to have indexed in order to serve your query with the block: `{ number_gte: $minBlock }` field argument as shown in the example below:

```graphql
{
  stakers(block: { number_gte: 14486109 }) {
    id
  }
}
```

More information about the nature of the network and how to handle re-orgs are described in the documentation article [Distributed Systems](/querying/distributed-systems/).

## Updating a Subgraph on the Network

If you would like to update an existing subgraph on the network, you can do this by deploying a new version of your subgraph to the Subgraph Studio using the Graph CLI.

1.  更改您当前的子图。一个好主意是通过向Goerli发布内容来测试Subgraph Studio的小修补程序。
2.  部署以下内容并在命令中指定新版本（例如 v0.0.1、v0.0.2 等）：

```sh
graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

3.  通过在 Playground 中查询来测试 Subgraph Studio 中的新版本。
4.  在 The Graph Network 上发布新版本。 请记住，这需要gas（如上一节所述）。

### Owner Update Fee: Deep Dive

> Note: Curation on Arbitrum does not use bonding curves. Learn more about Arbitrum [here](/arbitrum/arbitrum-faq/).

An update requires GRT to be migrated from the old version of the subgraph to the new version. This means that for every update, a new bonding curve will be created (more on bonding curves [here](/network/curating#bonding-curve-101)).

The new bonding curve charges the 1% curation tax on all GRT being migrated to the new version. The owner must pay 50% of this or 1.25%. The other 1.25% is absorbed by all the curators as a fee. This incentive design is in place to prevent an owner of a subgraph from being able to drain all their curator's funds with recursive update calls. If there is no curation activity, you will have to pay a minimum of 100 GRT in order to signal your own subgraph.

让我们举个例子，仅当您的子图正在获得积极时才策展会出现这种情况：

-   在子图的 v1 上使用自动迁移发出 100,000 GRT 信号
-   Owner updates to v2. 100,000 GRT is migrated to a new bonding curve, where 97,500 GRT get put into the new curve and 2,500 GRT is burned
-   The owner then has 1250 GRT burned to pay for half the fee. The owner must have this in their wallet before the update, otherwise, the update will not succeed. This happens in the same transaction as the update.

_While this mechanism is currently live on the network, the community is currently discussing ways to reduce the cost of updates for subgraph developers._

### 维护子图的稳定版本

If you're making a lot of changes to your subgraph, it is not a good idea to continually update it and front the update costs. Maintaining a stable and consistent version of your subgraph is critical, not only from the cost perspective but also so that Indexers can feel confident in their syncing times. Indexers should be flagged when you plan for an update so that Indexer syncing times do not get impacted. Feel free to leverage the [#Indexers channel](https://discord.gg/rC8rBuRtbH) on Discord to let Indexers know when you're versioning your subgraphs.

Subgraphs are open APIs that external developers are leveraging. Open APIs need to follow strict standards so that they do not break external developers' applications. In The Graph Network, a subgraph developer must consider Indexers and how long it takes them to sync a new subgraph **as well as** other developers who are using their subgraphs.

### 更新子图的元数据

您可以更新子图的元数据，而无需发布新版本。 元数据包括子图名称、图像、描述、网站 URL、源代码 URL 和类别。 开发人员可以通过在 Subgraph Studio 中更新他们的子图详细信息来实现，您可以在其中编辑所有适用的字段。

Make sure **Update Subgraph Details in Explorer** is checked and click on **Save**. If this is checked, an on-chain transaction will be generated that updates subgraph details in the Explorer without having to publish a new version with a new deployment.

## 将子图部署到Graph网络的最佳实践

1.  利用 ENS 名称进行子图开发：

-   Set up your ENS: <https://app.ens.domains/>
-   Add your ENS name to your settings [here](https://thegraph.com/explorer/settings?view=display-name).

2.  您的个人资料填写得越多，您的子图被索引和管理的机会就越大。

## 弃用Graph网络上的子图

Follow the steps [here](/managing/deprecating-a-subgraph) to deprecate your subgraph and remove it from The Graph Network.

## 在Graph网络上查询子图 + 计费

The hosted service was set up to allow developers to deploy their subgraphs without any restrictions.

In order for The Graph Network to truly be decentralized, query fees have to be paid as a core part of the protocol's incentives. For more information on subscribing to APIs and paying the query fees, check out billing documentation [here](/billing/).

### 估算网络上的查询费用

虽然这不是产品 UI 中的实时功能，但您可以通过将每月愿意支付的金额除以预期查询量来设置每次查询的最大预算。

While you get to decide on your query budget, there is no guarantee that an Indexer will be willing to serve queries at that price. If a Gateway can match you to an Indexer willing to serve a query at, or lower than, the price you are willing to pay, you will pay the delta/difference of your budget **and** their price. As a consequence, a lower query price reduces the pool of Indexers available to you, which may affect the quality of service you receive. It's beneficial to have high query fees, as that may attract curation and big-name Indexers to your subgraph.

请记住，这是一个充满活力且不断增长的市场，但您如何与之互动在您的控制之下。 协议或网关中没有指定最高或最低价格。 例如，您可以查看网络上一些 dapps 支付的价格（每周），如下所示。 请参阅最后一列，它显示了 GRT 中的查询费用。 例如，Pickle Finance 每秒有 个请求，支付 GRT 一周。
