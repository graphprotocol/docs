title: 在Base上构建子图
---

本指南将带你快速了解如何在Base测试网上初始化、创建和部署子图。

你将需要：

- A Base Sepolia testnet contract address
- 一个加密货币钱包（例如MetaMask或Coinbase钱包）

## 子图工作室

### 1. 安装 Graph CLI

Graph CLI(>=v0.41.0) 是用 JavaScript 编写的，你需要预安装npm 或yarn 包管理器才能使用。

```sh
# NPM
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# Yarn
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### 2. Create your subgraph in Subgraph Studio

Go to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and connect your crypto wallet.

Once connected, click "Create a Subgraph", enter a name for your subgraph and click Create a Subgraph.

### 3. 初始化子图

> You can find specific commands for your subgraph in Subgraph Studio.

确保graph-cli 更新到最新版本 (0.41.0以上)

```sh
graph --version
```

从现有合约初始化子图。

```sh
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

子图slug是子图的标识符。CLI工具将引导您完成创建子图的步骤，包括：

- 协议：ethereum
- 子图slug: `<SUBGRAPH_SLUG>`
- 创建子图的目录: `<SUBGRAPH_SLUG>`
- Ethereum network: base-sepolia
- Contract address: `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`
- Start block (optional)
- Contract name: `<CONTRACT_NAME>`
- Yes/no to indexing events (yes means your subgraph will be bootstrapped with entities in the schema and simple mappings for emitted events)

### 3. Write your Subgraph

> If emitted events are the only thing you want to index, then no additional work is required, and you can skip to the next step.

The previous command creates a scaffold subgraph that you can use as a starting point for building your subgraph. When making changes to the subgraph, you will mainly work with three files:

- Manifest (subgraph.yaml) - The manifest defines what datasources your subgraphs will index. Make sure to add `base-sepolia` as the network name in manifest file to deploy your subgraph on Base Sepolia.
- Schema (schema.graphql) - The GraphQL schema defines what data you wish to retreive from the subgraph.
- AssemblyScript 映射（mapping.ts）--将数据源中的数据转换为模式中定义的实体的代码。

If you want to index additional data, you will need extend the manifest, schema and mappings.

For more information on how to write your subgraph, see [Creating a Subgraph](/developing/creating-a-subgraph).

### 4. Deploy to Subgraph Studio

Before you can deploy your subgraph, you will need to authenticate with Subgraph Studio. You can do this by running the following command:

Authenticate the subgraph on studio

```
graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
```

Next, enter your subgraph's directory.

```
    cd <SUBGRAPH_DIRECTORY>
```

Build your subgraph with the following command:

````
```
graph codegen && graph build
```
````

Finally, you can deploy your subgraph using this command:

````
```
graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```
````

### 5. Query your subgraph

Once your subgraph is deployed, you can query it from your dapp using the `Development Query URL` in Subgraph Studio.

Note - Studio API is rate-limited. Hence should preferably be used for development and testing.

To learn more about querying data from your subgraph, see the [Querying a Subgraph](/querying/querying-the-graph) page.
