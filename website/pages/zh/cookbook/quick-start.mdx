本指南将快速带您了解如何初始化、创建子图，并将其部署到子图工作室或[托管服务](#hosted-service)。

确保您的子图将索引来自[支持的网络](/developing/supported-networks)的数据。

This guide is written assuming that you have:

- A smart contract address on the network of your choice
- GRT to curate your subgraph
- A crypto wallet

## 1. Create a subgraph on Subgraph Studio

进入子图工作室 [https://thegraph.com/studio/](https://thegraph.com/studio/) 并连接钱包。

Once connected, you can begin by clicking “create a subgraph.” Select the network of your choice and click continue.

## 2. Install the Graph CLI

Graph CLI 是用 JavaScript 编写的，需要安装`npm` 或`yarn` 来使用。

On your local machine, run one of the following commands:

```sh
# NPM
$ npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# Yarn
$ yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

## 3. Initialize your Subgraph

> You can find commands for your specific subgraph on the subgraph page in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

When you initialize your subgraph, the CLI tool will ask you for the following information:

- Protocol: choose the protocol your subgraph will be indexing data from
- Subgraph slug: create a name for your subgraph. Your subgraph slug is an identifier for your subgraph.
- Directory to create the subgraph in: choose your local directory
- Ethereum network(optional): you may need to specify which EVM-compatible network your subgraph will be indexing data from
- Contract address: Locate the smart contract address you’d like to query data from
- ABI: If the ABI is not autopopulated, you will need to input it manually as a JSON file
- Start Block: it is suggested that you input the start block to save time while your subgraph indexes blockchain data. You can locate the start block by finding the block where your contract was deployed.
- Contract Name: input the name of your contract
- Index contract events as entities: it is suggested that you set this to true as it will automatically add mappings to your subgraph for every emitted event
- Add another contract(optional): you can add another contract

Initialize your subgraph from an existing contract by running the following command:

```sh
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

See the following screenshot for an example for what to expect when initializing your subgraph:

## 4. Write your Subgraph

前面的命令创建了一个原始子图，可以将其用作构建子图的起点。当对子图进行更改时，将主要使用三个文件:

- 清单（subgraph.yaml）--清单定义子图将索引哪些数据源。
- 模式（schema.graphql）--GraphQL 模式定义从子图中检索到的数据。
- AssemblyScript 映射（mapping.ts）--将数据源中的数据转换为模式中定义的实体的代码。

关于如何编写子图的更多信息，请参见 [创建子图](/developing/creating-a-subgraph)

## 5. Deploy to the Subgraph Studio

Once your subgraph is written, run the following commands:

```sh
$ graph codegen
$ graph build
```

- 认证并部署子图。部署密钥可以在子图工作室的子图页面上找到。

```sh
$ graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
$ graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

You will be asked for a version label. It's strongly recommended to use [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning like `0.0.1`. That said, you are free to choose any string as version such as:`v1`, `version1`, `asdf`.

## 6. Test your subgraph

You can test your subgraph by making a sample query in the playground section.

The logs will tell you if there are any errors with your subgraph. The logs of an operational subgraph will look like this:

![Subgraph logs](/img/subgraph-logs-image.png)

If your subgraph is failing, you can query the subgraph health by using the GraphiQL Playground. Note that you can leverage the query below and input your deployment ID for your subgraph. In this case, `Qm...` is the deployment ID (which can be located on the Subgraph page under **Details**). The query below will tell you when a subgraph fails, so you can debug accordingly:

```graphql
{
  indexingStatuses(subgraphs: ["Qm..."]) {
    node
    synced
    health
    fatalError {
      message
      block {
        number
        hash
      }
      handler
    }
    nonFatalErrors {
      message
      block {
        number
        hash
      }
      handler
    }
    chains {
      network
      chainHeadBlock {
        number
      }
      earliestBlock {
        number
      }
      latestBlock {
        number
      }
      lastHealthyBlock {
        number
      }
    }
    entityCount
  }
}
```

## 7. Publish Your Subgraph to The Graph’s Decentralized Network

Once your subgraph has been deployed to the Subgraph Studio, you have tested it out, and are ready to put it into production, you can then publish it to the decentralized network.

In the Subgraph Studio, click on your subgraph. On the subgraph’s page, you will be able to click the publish button on the top right.

Select the network you would like to publish your subgraph to. It is recommended to publish subgraphs to Arbitrum One to take advantage of the [faster transaction speeds and lower gas costs](../arbitrum-faq).

Before you can query your subgraph, Indexers need to begin serving queries on it. In order to streamline this process, you can curate your own subgraph using GRT.

At the time of writing, it is recommended that you curate your own subgraph with 10,000 GRT to ensure that it is indexed and available for querying as soon as possible.

To save on gas costs, you can curate your subgraph in the same transaction that you published it by selecting this button when you publish your subgraph to The Graph’s decentralized network:

## 8. Query your Subgraph

Now, you can query your subgraph by sending GraphQL queries to your subgraph’s Query URL, which you can find by clicking on the query button.

You can query from your dapp if you don't have your API key via the free, rate-limited temporary query URL that can be used for development and staging.

For more information about querying data from your subgraph, read more [here](../querying/querying-the-graph/).
