title: How to Use the Subgraph Studio
---

欢迎使用您的新启动板👩🏽‍🚀

The Subgraph Studio is your place to build and create subgraphs, add metadata, and publish them to the new decentralized Explorer (more on that [here](/network/explorer)).

What you can do in the Subgraph Studio:

- 通过 Studio UI 创建子图
- 使用 CLI 部署子图
- Publish a subgraph with the Studio UI
- 在面板上测试子图
- 使用查询 URL 将其集成到暂存中
- 为特定子图创建和管理 API 密钥

Here in the Subgraph Studio, you have full control over your subgraphs. Not only can you test your subgraphs before you publish them, but you can also restrict your API keys to specific domains and only allow certain Indexers to query from their API keys.

Querying subgraphs generates query fees, used to reward [Indexers](/network/indexing) on the Graph network. If you’re a dapp developer or subgraph developer, the Studio will empower you to build better subgraphs to power your or your community’s queries. The Studio is comprised of 5 main parts:

- 您的用户账户控件
- 您创建的子图列表
- A section to manage, view details and visualize the status of a specific subgraph
- 用于管理 API 密钥的部分，您需要查询子图
- A section to manage your billing

## How to Create Your Account

1. 使用您的钱包登录 - 您可以通过 MetaMask 或 WalletConnect 进行此操作
1. 一旦您登录，您将在您的账户主页上看到您唯一的部署密钥。这将允许您发布您的子图或管理您的 API 密钥 + 计费。您将拥有一个惟一的部署密钥，如果您认为该密钥已被破坏，则可以重新生成该密钥。

## How to Create your Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

最好的部分！ 当您第一次创建子图时，您将被指示填写：

- 您的子图名称
- 图片
- 描述
- 类别 (e.g. `DeFi`, `NFTs`, `Governance`)
- 网站

## Subgraph Compatibility with The Graph Network

The Graph Network is not yet able to support all of the data-sources & features available on the Hosted Service. In order to be supported by Indexers on the network, subgraphs must:

- Index a [supported network](/developing/supported-networks)
- 不得使用以下任何功能：
  - ipfs.cat & ipfs.map
  - Non-fatal errors
  - Grafting

More features & networks will be added to The Graph Network incrementally.

### 子图生命周期流程

![Subgraph Lifecycle](/img/subgraph-lifecycle.png)

After you have created your subgraph, you will be able to deploy it using the [CLI](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli), or command-line interface. Deploying a subgraph with the CLI will push the subgraph to the Studio where you’ll be able to test subgraphs using the playground. This will eventually allow you to publish to the Graph Network. For more information on CLI setup, [check this out](/developing/defining-a-subgraph#install-the-graph-cli) (pst, make sure you have your deploy key on hand). Remember, deploying is **not the same as** publishing. When you deploy a subgraph, you just push it to the Studio where you’re able to test it. Versus, when you publish a subgraph, you are publishing it on-chain.

## Testing your Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

If you’d like to test your subgraph before publishing it to the network, you can do this in the Subgraph **Playground** or look at your logs. The Subgraph logs will tell you **where** your subgraph fails in the case that it does.

## Publish your Subgraph in Subgraph Studio

You’ve made it this far - congrats!

In order to publish your subgraph successfully, you’ll need to go through the following steps outlined in this [blog](https://thegraph.com/blog/building-with-subgraph-studio).

Check out the video overview below as well:

Remember, while you’re going through your publishing flow, you’ll be able to push to either mainnet or Goerli. If you’re a first-time subgraph developer, we highly suggest you start with publishing to Goerli, which is free to do. This will allow you to see how the subgraph will work in The Graph Explorer and will allow you to test curation elements.

Indexers need to submit mandatory Proof of Indexing records as of a specific block hash. Because publishing a subgraph is an action taken on-chain, remember that the transaction can take up to a few minutes to go through. Any address you use to publish the contract will be the only one able to publish future versions. Choose wisely!

Subgraphs with curation signal are shown to Indexers so that they can be indexed on the decentralized network. You can publish subgraphs and signal in one transaction, which allows you to mint the first curation signal on the subgraph and saves on gas costs. By adding your signal to the signal later provided by Curators, your subgraph will also have a higher chance of ultimately serving queries.

## 使用 CLI 对子图进行版本控制

Developers might want to update their subgraph, for a variety of reasons. When this is the case, you can deploy a new version of your subgraph to the Studio using the CLI (it will only be private at this point) and if you are happy with it, you can publish this new deployment to The Graph Explorer. This will create a new version of your subgraph that curators can start signaling on and Indexers will be able to index this new version.

Up until recently, developers were forced to deploy and publish a new version of their subgraph to the Explorer to update the metadata of their subgraphs. Now, developers can update the metadata of their subgraphs **without having to publish a new version**. Developers can update their subgraph details in the Studio (under the profile picture, name, description, etc) by checking an option called **Update Details** in The Graph Explorer. If this is checked, an on-chain transaction will be generated that updates subgraph details in the Explorer without having to publish a new version with a new deployment.

请注意，在网络上发布子图的新版本是有成本的。除了交易费用，开发人员还必须为自动迁移信号的部分策展税提供资金。如果策展人没有在子图上发出信号，则不能发布子图的新版本。更多关于策展风险的信息，请点击[这里](/network/curating)阅读。

### 子图版本的自动归档

Whenever you deploy a new subgraph version in the Subgraph Studio, the previous version will be archived. Archived versions won't be indexed/synced and therefore cannot be queried. You can unarchive an archived version of your subgraph in the Studio UI. Please note that previous versions of non-published subgraphs deployed to the Studio will be automatically archived.
