title: Network Overview

The Graph Network is a decentralized indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. Applications use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, developers can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

## Overview

The Graph Network consists of Indexers, Curators and Delegators that provide services to the network, and serve data to Web3 applications. Consumers use the applications and consume the data.

To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants stake and use Graph Tokens ([GRT](/tokenomics)). GRT is a work utility token that is an ERC-20 used to allocate resources in the network.

Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can provide services and earn income from the network, proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake.
