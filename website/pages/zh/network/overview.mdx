The Graph Network is a decentralized indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. Applications use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, developers can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

## 概述

The Graph 网络由索引人、策展人和委托人组成，为网络提供服务，并为 Web3 应用程序提供数据。 消费者使用应用程序并消费数据。

To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants stake and use Graph Tokens ([GRT](/tokenomics)). GRT is a work utility token that is an ERC-20 used to allocate resources in the network.

Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can provide services and earn income from the network, proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake.
