title: Indexing
---

索引人是Graph 网络中的节点运营商，他们质押 Graph 通证 (GRT) 以提供索引和查询处理服务。 索引人通过他们的服务赚取查询费和索引奖励。 他们还根据 Cobbs-Douglas 回扣函数从回扣池中赚取收益，该回扣池与所有网络贡献者按他们的工作成比例共享。

抵押在协议中的 GRT 会受到解冻期的影响，如果索引人是恶意的并向应用程序提供不正确的数据或索引不正确，则可能会被削减。 索引人也可以从委托人那里获得委托，为网络做出贡献。

索引人根据子图的管理信号选择要索引的子图，其中管理员质押 GRT 以指示哪些子图是高质量的并应优先考虑。 消费者（例如应用程序）还可以设置索引人处理其子图查询的参数，并设置查询费用定价的偏好。

<Difficulty level="ADVANCED" />

## 常见问题

### What is the minimum stake required to be an Indexer on the network?

索引人的最低抵押数量目前设置为 10万个 GRT。

### What are the revenue streams for an Indexer?

**Query fee rebates** - Payments for serving queries on the network. These payments are mediated via state channels between an Indexer and a gateway. Each query request from a gateway contains a payment and the corresponding response a proof of query result validity.

**Indexing rewards** - Generated via a 3% annual protocol wide inflation, the indexing rewards are distributed to Indexers who are indexing subgraph deployments for the network.

### How are indexing rewards distributed?

Indexing rewards come from protocol inflation which is set to 3% annual issuance. They are distributed across subgraphs based on the proportion of all curation signal on each, then distributed proportionally to Indexers based on their allocated stake on that subgraph. **An allocation must be closed with a valid proof of indexing (POI) that meets the standards set by the arbitration charter in order to be eligible for rewards.**

Numerous tools have been created by the community for calculating rewards; you'll find a collection of them organized in the [Community Guides collection](https://www.notion.so/Community-Guides-abbb10f4dba040d5ba81648ca093e70c). You can also find an up to date list of tools in the #Delegators and #Indexers channels on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP). Here we link a [recommended allocation optimiser](https://github.com/graphprotocol/AllocationOpt.jl) integrated with the indexer software stack.

### 什么是索引证明 (POI)？

POIs are used in the network to verify that an Indexer is indexing the subgraphs they have allocated on. A POI for the first block of the current epoch must be submitted when closing an allocation for that allocation to be eligible for indexing rewards. A POI for a block is a digest for all entity store transactions for a specific subgraph deployment up to and including that block.

### When are indexing rewards distributed?

Allocations are continuously accruing rewards while they're active and allocated within 28 epochs. Rewards are collected by the Indexers, and distributed whenever their allocations are closed. That happens either manually, whenever the Indexer wants to force close them, or after 28 epochs a Delegator can close the allocation for the Indexer, but this results in no rewards. 28 epochs is the max allocation lifetime (right now, one epoch lasts for ~24h).

### Can pending indexing rewards be monitored?

The RewardsManager contract has a read-only [getRewards](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/master/contracts/rewards/RewardsManager.sol#L317) function that can be used to check the pending rewards for a specific allocation.

Many of the community-made dashboards include pending rewards values and they can be easily checked manually by following these steps:

1. Query the [mainnet subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/graphprotocol/graph-network-mainnet) to get the IDs for all active allocations:

```graphql
query indexerAllocations {
  indexer(id: "<INDEXER_ADDRESS>") {
    allocations {
      activeForIndexer {
        allocations {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

使用 Etherscan 调用 `getRewards()`:

- 导航到[奖励合约的 Etherscan 界面](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9Ac758AB77733b4150A901ebd659cbF8cB93ED66#readProxyContract)

* 调用`getRewards()`:
  - Expand the **10. getRewards** dropdown.
  - 在输入中输入**分配 ID**.
  - 点击**查询**按钮.

### What are disputes and where can I view them?

Indexer's queries and allocations can both be disputed on The Graph during the dispute period. The dispute period varies, depending on the type of dispute. Queries/attestations have 7 epochs dispute window, whereas allocations have 56 epochs. After these periods pass, disputes cannot be opened against either of allocations or queries. When a dispute is opened, a deposit of a minimum of 10,000 GRT is required by the Fishermen, which will be locked until the dispute is finalized and a resolution has been given. Fisherman are any network participants that open disputes.

Disputes have **three** possible outcomes, so does the deposit of the Fishermen.

- If the dispute is rejected, the GRT deposited by the Fishermen will be burned, and the disputed Indexer will not be slashed.
- If the dispute is settled as a draw, the Fishermen's deposit will be returned, and the disputed Indexer will not be slashed.
- If the dispute is accepted, the GRT deposited by the Fishermen will be returned, the disputed Indexer will be slashed and the Fishermen will earn 50% of the slashed GRT.

争议可以在用户界面中的 `争议`标签下的索引人档案页中查看。

### What are query fee rebates and when are they distributed?

Query fees are collected by the gateway whenever an allocation is closed and accumulated in the subgraph's query fee rebate pool. The rebate pool is designed to encourage Indexers to allocate stake in rough proportion to the amount of query fees they earn for the network. The portion of query fees in the pool that are allocated to a particular Indexer is calculated using the Cobb-Douglas Production Function; the distributed amount per Indexer is a function of their contributions to the pool and their allocation of stake on the subgraph.

Once an allocation has been closed and the dispute period has passed the rebates are available to be claimed by the Indexer. Upon claiming, the query fee rebates are distributed to the Indexer and their Delegators based on the query fee cut and the delegation pool proportions.

### 什么是查询费减免和索引奖励减免？

The `queryFeeCut` and `indexingRewardCut` values are delegation parameters that the Indexer may set along with cooldownBlocks to control the distribution of GRT between the Indexer and their Delegators. See the last steps in [Staking in the Protocol](/network/indexing#stake-in-the-protocol) for instructions on setting the delegation parameters.

- **queryFeeCut** - the % of query fee rebates accumulated on a subgraph that will be distributed to the Indexer. If this is set to 95%, the Indexer will receive 95% of the query fee rebate pool when an allocation is claimed with the other 5% going to the Delegators.

- **indexingRewardCut** - the % of indexing rewards accumulated on a subgraph that will be distributed to the Indexer. If this is set to 95%, the Indexer will receive 95% of the indexing rewards pool when an allocation is closed and the Delegators will split the other 5%.

### How do Indexers know which subgraphs to index?

Indexers may differentiate themselves by applying advanced techniques for making subgraph indexing decisions but to give a general idea we'll discuss several key metrics used to evaluate subgraphs in the network:

- **策展信号** - 应用于特定子图的网络策展信号的比例是对该子图兴趣的一个很好的指标，尤其是在引导阶段，当查询量不断上升时。

- **收取的查询费** - 特定子图收取的查询费的历史数据是未来需求的良好指标。

- **Amount staked** - Monitoring the behavior of other Indexers or looking at proportions of total stake allocated towards specific subgraphs can allow an Indexer to monitor the supply side for subgraph queries to identify subgraphs that the network is showing confidence in or subgraphs that may show a need for more supply.

- **没有索引奖励的子图** - 一些子图不会产生索引奖励，主要是因为它们使用了不受支持的功能，如 IPFS，或者因为它们正在查询主网之外的另一个网络。 如果子图未生成索引奖励，您将在子图上看到一条消息。

### 对硬件有什么要求？

- **小型** - 足以开始索引几个子图，可能需要扩展。
- **标准** - 默认设置，这是在 k8s/terraform 部署清单示例中使用的。
- **Medium** - Production Indexer supporting 100 subgraphs and 200-500 requests per second.
- **Large** - Prepared to index all currently used subgraphs and serve requests for the related traffic.

| 设置 | (CPU 数量) | (内存 GB) | (硬盘 TB) | (CPU 数量) | (内存 GB) |
| -- |:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| 小型 |    4     |    8    |    1    |    4     |   16    |
| 标准 |    8     |   30    |    1    |    12    |   48    |
| 中型 |    16    |   64    |    2    |    32    |   64    |
| 大型 |    72    |   468   |   3.5   |    48    |   184   |

### What are some basic security precautions an Indexer should take?

- **Operator wallet** - Setting up an operator wallet is an important precaution because it allows an Indexer to maintain separation between their keys that control stake and those that are in control of day-to-day operations. See [Stake in Protocol](/network/indexing#stake-in-the-protocol) for instructions.

- **Firewall** - Only the Indexer service needs to be exposed publicly and particular attention should be paid to locking down admin ports and database access: the Graph Node JSON-RPC endpoint (default port: 8030), the Indexer management API endpoint (default port: 18000), and the Postgres database endpoint (default port: 5432) should not be exposed.

## 基础设施

At the center of an Indexer's infrastructure is the Graph Node which monitors the indexed networks, extracts and loads data per a subgraph definition and serves it as a [GraphQL API](/about/#how-the-graph-works). The Graph Node needs to be connected to an endpoint exposing data from each indexed network; an IPFS node for sourcing data; a PostgreSQL database for its store; and Indexer components which facilitate its interactions with the network.

- **PostgreSQL database** - The main store for the Graph Node, this is where subgraph data is stored. The Indexer service and agent also use the database to store state channel data, cost models, indexing rules, and allocation actions.

- **Data endpoint** - For EVM-compatible networks, Graph Node needs to be connected to an endpoint that exposes an EVM-compatible JSON-RPC API. This may take the form of a single client or it could be a more complex setup that load balances across multiple. It's important to be aware that certain subgraphs will require particular client capabilities such as archive mode and/or the parity tracing API.

- **IPFS node (version less than 5)** - Subgraph deployment metadata is stored on the IPFS network. The Graph Node primarily accesses the IPFS node during subgraph deployment to fetch the subgraph manifest and all linked files. Network Indexers do not need to host their own IPFS node, an IPFS node for the network is hosted at https://ipfs.network.thegraph.com.

- **Indexer service** - Handles all required external communications with the network. Shares cost models and indexing statuses, passes query requests from gateways on to a Graph Node, and manages the query payments via state channels with the gateway.

- **Indexer agent** - Facilitates the Indexers interactions on chain including registering on the network, managing subgraph deployments to its Graph Node/s, and managing allocations.

- **Prometheus 指标服务器** - Graph 节点 和索引人组件将其指标记录到指标服务器。

注意：为了支持敏捷扩展，建议在不同的节点集之间分开查询和索引问题：查询节点和索引节点。

### 端口概述

### Setup server infrastructure using Terraform on Google Cloud

> Note: Indexers can alternatively use AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Alibaba.

#### 安装先决条件

- 谷歌云 SDK
- Kubectl 命令行工具
- Terraform

#### 创建一个谷歌云项目

- Clone or navigate to the Indexer repository.

- 导航到./terraform 目录，这是所有命令应该执行的地方。

```sh
cd terraform
```

- 通过谷歌云认证并创建一个新项目。

```sh
gcloud auth login
project=<PROJECT_NAME>
gcloud projects create --enable-cloud-apis $project
```

- 使用 Google Cloud Console 的计费页面为新项目启用计费。

- 创建谷歌云配置。

```sh
proj_id=$(gcloud projects list --format='get(project_id)' --filter="name=$project")
gcloud config configurations create $project
gcloud config set project "$proj_id"
gcloud config set compute/region us-central1
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a
```

- 启用所需的 Google Cloud API。

```sh
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable servicenetworking.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
```

- 创建一个服务账户。

```sh
svc_name=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
gcloud iam service-accounts create $svc_name \
  --description="Service account for Terraform" \
  --display-name="$svc_name"
gcloud iam service-accounts list
# Get the email of the service account from the list
svc=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --format='get(email)'
--filter="displayName=$svc_name")
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create .gcloud-credentials.json \
  --iam-account="$svc"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $proj_id \
  --member serviceAccount:$svc \
  --role roles/editor
```

- 启用将在下一步中创建的数据库和 Kubernetes 集群之间的对等连接。

```sh
gcloud compute addresses create google-managed-services-default \
  --prefix-length=20 \
  --purpose=VPC_PEERING \
  --network default \
  --global \
  --description 'IP Range for peer networks.'
gcloud services vpc-peerings connect \
  --network=default \
  --ranges=google-managed-services-default
```

- 创建最小的 terraform 配置文件（根据需要更新）。

```sh
indexer=<INDEXER_NAME>
cat > terraform.tfvars <<EOF
project = "$proj_id"
indexer = "$indexer"
database_password = "<database passowrd>"
EOF
```

#### 使用 Terraform 创建基础设施

在运行任何命令之前，先阅读 [variables.tf](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/terraform/variables.tf) 并在这个目录下创建一个文件`terraform.tfvars`（或者修改我们在上一步创建的文件）。 对于每一个想要覆盖默认值的变量，或者需要设置值的变量，在 `terraform.tfvars`中输入一个设置。

- 运行以下命令来创建基础设施。

```sh
# Install required plugins
terraform init

# View plan for resources to be created
terraform plan

# Create the resources (expect it to take up to 30 minutes)
terraform apply
```

Download credentials for the new cluster into `~/.kube/config` and set it as your default context.

```sh
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $indexer
kubectl config use-context $(kubectl config get-contexts --output='name'
| grep $indexer)
```

#### Creating the Kubernetes components for the Indexer

- Copy the directory `k8s/overlays` to a new directory `$dir,` and adjust the `bases` entry in `$dir/kustomization.yaml` so that it points to the directory `k8s/base`.

- 读取`$dir`中的所有文件，并按照注释中的指示调整任何值。

用以下方法部署所有资源`kubectl apply -k $dir`.

### Graph 节点

[Graph 节点](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) 是一个开源的 Rust 实现，它将以太坊区块链事件源化，以确定地更新一个数据存储，可以通过 GraphQL 端点进行查询。 开发者使用子图来定义他们的模式，以及一组用于转换区块链来源数据的映射，Graph 节点处理同步整个链，监控新的区块，并通过 GraphQL 端点提供服务。

#### Getting started from source

#### 安装先决条件

- **Rust**

- **PostgreSQL**

- **IPFS**

- **Additional Requirements for Ubuntu users** - To run a Graph Node on Ubuntu a few additional packages may be needed.

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y clang libpg-dev libssl-dev pkg-config
```

#### 设置

1. Start a PostgreSQL database server

```sh
initdb -D .postgres
pg_ctl -D .postgres -l logfile start
createdb graph-node
```

2. Clone [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) repo and build the source by running `cargo build`

3. Now that all the dependencies are setup, start the Graph Node:

```sh
cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \
  --postgres-url postgresql://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/graph-node \
  --ethereum-rpc [NETWORK_NAME]:[URL] \
  --ipfs https://ipfs.network.thegraph.com
```

#### Getting started using Docker

#### 先决条件

- **Ethereum node** - By default, the docker compose setup will use mainnet: [http://host.docker.internal:8545](http://host.docker.internal:8545) to connect to the Ethereum node on your host machine. You can replace this network name and url by updating `docker-compose.yaml`.

#### 设置

1. Clone Graph Node and navigate to the Docker directory:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node
cd graph-node/docker
```

2. 仅适用于 linux 用户 - 在`docker-compose.yaml`中使用主机 IP 地址代替 `host.docker.internal`并使用附带的脚本。

```sh
./setup.sh
```

3. 启动一个本地 Graph 节点，它将连接到你的以太坊端点。

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### 索引人组件

To successfully participate in the network requires almost constant monitoring and interaction, so we've built a suite of Typescript applications for facilitating an Indexers network participation. There are three Indexer components:

- **Indexer agent** - The agent monitors the network and the Indexer's own infrastructure and manages which subgraph deployments are indexed and allocated towards on chain and how much is allocated towards each.

- **索引人服务** - 唯一需要对外暴露的组件，该服务将子图查询传递给节点，管理查询支付的状态通道，将重要的决策信息分享给网关等客户端。

- **Indexer CLI** - The command line interface for managing the Indexer agent. It allows Indexers to manage cost models, manual allocations, actions queue, and indexing rules.

#### 开始

The Indexer agent and Indexer service should be co-located with your Graph Node infrastructure. There are many ways to set up virtual execution environments for your Indexer components; here we'll explain how to run them on baremetal using NPM packages or source, or via kubernetes and docker on the Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine. If these setup examples do not translate well to your infrastructure there will likely be a community guide to reference, come say hi on [Discord](https://thegraph.com/discord)! Remember to [stake in the protocol](/network/indexing#stake-in-the-protocol) before starting up your Indexer components!

#### 来自 NPM 包

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/indexer-service
npm install -g @graphprotocol/indexer-agent

# Indexer CLI is a plugin for Graph CLI, so both need to be installed:
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
npm install -g @graphprotocol/indexer-cli

# Indexer service
graph-indexer-service start ...

# Indexer agent
graph-indexer-agent start ...

# Indexer CLI
#Forward the port of your agent pod if using Kubernetes
kubectl port-forward pod/POD_ID 18000:8000
graph indexer connect http://localhost:18000/
graph indexer ...
```

#### From source

```sh
# From Repo root directory
yarn

# Indexer Service
cd packages/indexer-service
./bin/graph-indexer-service start ...

# Indexer agent
cd packages/indexer-agent
./bin/graph-indexer-service start ...

# Indexer CLI
cd packages/indexer-cli
./bin/graph-indexer-cli indexer connect http://localhost:18000/
./bin/graph-indexer-cli indexer ...
```

#### 使用 docker

- 从注册表中提取图像

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/graphprotocol/indexer-service:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/graphprotocol/indexer-agent:latest
```

Or build images locally from source

```sh
# Indexer service
docker build \
  --build-arg NPM_TOKEN=<npm-token> \
  -f Dockerfile.indexer-service \
  -t indexer-service:latest \
# Indexer agent
docker build \
  --build-arg NPM_TOKEN=<npm-token> \
  -f Dockerfile.indexer-agent \
  -t indexer-agent:latest \
```

- 运行组件

```sh
docker run -p 7600:7600 -it indexer-service:latest ...
docker run -p 18000:8000 -it indexer-agent:latest ...
```

**NOTE**: After starting the containers, the Indexer service should be accessible at [http://localhost:7600](http://localhost:7600) and the Indexer agent should be exposing the Indexer management API at [http://localhost:18000/](http://localhost:18000/).

#### 使用 K8s 和 Terraform

See the [Setup Server Infrastructure Using Terraform on Google Cloud](/network/indexing#setup-server-infrastructure-using-terraform-on-google-cloud) section

#### Usage

> **注意**: 所有的运行时配置变量可以在启动时作为参数应用到命令中，也可以使用格式为 `COMPONENT_NAME_VARIABLE_NAME`(ex. `INDEXER_AGENT_ETHEREUM`) 的环境变量。

#### 索引人 CLI

Indexer CLI 是一个可以在终端访问`graph indexer`的插件，地址是[`@graphprotocol/graph-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)。

```sh
graph indexer connect http://localhost:18000
graph indexer status
```

#### Indexer management using Indexer CLI

The suggested tool for interacting with the **Indexer Management API** is the **Indexer CLI**, an extension to the **Graph CLI**. The Indexer agent needs input from an Indexer in order to autonomously interact with the network on the behalf of the Indexer. The mechanism for defining Indexer agent behavior are **allocation management** mode and **indexing rules**. Under auto mode, an Indexer can use **indexing rules** to apply their specific strategy for picking subgraphs to index and serve queries for. Rules are managed via a GraphQL API served by the agent and known as the Indexer Management API. Under manual mode, an Indexer can create allocation actions using **actions queue** and explicitly approve them before they get executed. Under oversight mode, **indexing rules** are used to populate **actions queue** and also require explicit approval for execution.

#### Usage

The **Indexer CLI** connects to the Indexer agent, typically through port-forwarding, so the CLI does not need to run on the same server or cluster. To help you get started, and to provide some context, the CLI will briefly be described here.

- `graph indexer connect <url>` - Connect to the Indexer management API. Typically the connection to the server is opened via port forwarding, so the CLI can be easily operated remotely. (Example: `kubectl port-forward pod/<indexer-agent-pod> 8000:8000`)

- `graph indexer rules get [options] <deployment-id> [<key1> ...]` - Get one or more indexing rules using `all` as the `<deployment-id>` to get all rules, or `global` to get the global defaults. An additional argument `--merged` can be used to specify that deployment specific rules are merged with the global rule. This is how they are applied in the Indexer agent.

- `graph indexer rules set [options] <deployment-id> <key1> <value1> ...` -设置一个或多个索引规则。

- `graph indexer rules start [options] <deployment-id>` - Start indexing a subgraph deployment if available and set its `decisionBasis` to `always`, so the Indexer agent will always choose to index it. If the global rule is set to always then all available subgraphs on the network will be indexed.

- `graph indexer rules stop [options] <deployment-id>` -停止对某个部署进行索引，并将其 `decisionBasis`设置为 never, 这样它在决定要索引的部署时就会跳过这个部署。

- `graph indexer rules maybe [options] <deployment-id>` — Set the `decisionBasis` for a deployment to `rules`, so that the Indexer agent will use indexing rules to decide whether to index this deployment.

- `graph indexer actions get [options] <action-id>` - Fetch one or more actions using `all` or leave `action-id` empty to get all actions. An additonal argument `--status` can be used to print out all actions of a certain status.

- `graph indexer action queue allocate <deployment-id> <allocation-amount>` - Queue allocation action

- `graph indexer action queue reallocate <deployment-id> <allocation-id> <allocationAmount>` - Queue reallocate action

- `graph indexer action queue unallocate <deployment-id> <allocation-id>` - Queue unallocate action

- `graph indexer actions cancel [<action-id> ...]` - Cancel all action in the queue if id is unspecified, otherwise cancel array of id with space as separator

- `graph indexer actions approve [<action-id> ...]` - Approve multiple actions for execution

- `graph indexer actions execute approve` - Force the worker to execute approved actions immediately

All commands which display rules in the output can choose between the supported output formats (`table`, `yaml`, and `json`) using the `-output` argument.

#### 索引规则

Indexing rules can either be applied as global defaults or for specific subgraph deployments using their IDs. The `deployment` and `decisionBasis` fields are mandatory, while all other fields are optional. When an indexing rule has `rules` as the `decisionBasis`, then the Indexer agent will compare non-null threshold values on that rule with values fetched from the network for the corresponding deployment. If the subgraph deployment has values above (or below) any of the thresholds it will be chosen for indexing.

For example, if the global rule has a `minStake` of **5** (GRT), any subgraph deployment which has more than 5 (GRT) of stake allocated to it will be indexed. Threshold rules include `maxAllocationPercentage`, `minSignal`, `maxSignal`, `minStake`, and `minAverageQueryFees`.

Data model:

```graphql
type IndexingRule {
    identifier: string
    identifierType: IdentifierType
    decisionBasis: IndexingDecisionBasis!
    allocationAmount: number | null
    allocationLifetime: number | null
    autoRenewal: boolean
    parallelAllocations: number | null
    maxAllocationPercentage: number | null
    minSignal: string | null
    maxSignal: string | null
    minStake: string | null
    minAverageQueryFees: string | null
    custom: string | null
    requireSupported: boolean | null
  }

IdentifierType {
  deployment
  subgraph
  group
}

IndexingDecisionBasis {
  rules
  never
  always
  offchain
}
```

Example usage of indexing rule:

```
graph indexer rules offchain QmZfeJYR86UARzp9HiXbURWunYgC9ywvPvoePNbuaATrEK

graph indexer rules set QmZfeJYR86UARzp9HiXbURWunYgC9ywvPvoePNbuaATrEK decisionBasis always allocationAmount 123321 allocationLifetime 14 autoRenewal false requireSupported false

graph indexer rules stop QmZfeJYR86UARzp9HiXbURWunYgC9ywvPvoePNbuaATrEK

graph indexer rules delete QmZfeJYR86UARzp9HiXbURWunYgC9ywvPvoePNbuaATrEK
```

#### Actions queue CLI

The indexer-cli provides an `actions` module for manually working with the action queue. It uses the **Graphql API** hosted by the indexer management server to interact with the actions queue.

The action execution worker will only grab items from the queue to execute if they have `ActionStatus = approved`. In the recommended path actions are added to the queue with ActionStatus = queued, so they must then be approved in order to be executed on-chain. The general flow will look like:

- Action added to the queue by the 3rd party optimizer tool or indexer-cli user
- Indexer can use the `indexer-cli` to view all queued actions
- Indexer (or other software) can approve or cancel actions in the queue using the `indexer-cli`. The approve and cancel commands take an array of action ids as input.
- The execution worker regularly polls the queue for approved actions. It will grab the `approved` actions from the queue, attempt to execute them, and update the values in the db depending on the status of execution to `success` or `failed`.
- If an action is successful the worker will ensure that there is an indexing rule present that tells the agent how to manage the allocation moving forward, useful when taking manual actions while the agent is in `auto` or `oversight` mode.
- The indexer can monitor the action queue to see a history of action execution and if needed re-approve and update action items if they failed execution. The action queue provides a history of all actions queued and taken.

Data model:

```graphql
Type ActionInput {
    status: ActionStatus
    type: ActionType
    deploymentID: string | null
    allocationID: string | null
    amount: string | null
    poi: string | null
    force: boolean | null
    source: string
    reason: string | null
    priority: number | null
}

ActionStatus {
  queued
  approved
  pending
  success
  failed
  canceled
}

ActionType {
  allocate
  unallocate
  reallocate
  collect
}
```

Example usage from source:

```bash
indexer indexer actions get all

indexer indexer actions get --status queued

indexer indexer actions queue allocate QmeqJ6hsdyk9dVbo1tvRgAxWrVS3rkERiEMsxzPShKLco6 5000

indexer indexer actions queue reallocate QmeqJ6hsdyk9dVbo1tvRgAxWrVS3rkERiEMsxzPShKLco6 0x4a58d33e27d3acbaecc92c15101fbc82f47c2ae5 55000

indexer indexer actions queue unallocate QmeqJ6hsdyk9dVbo1tvRgAxWrVS3rkERiEMsxzPShKLco6 0x4a58d33e27d3acbaecc92c15101fbc82f47c2ae

indexer indexer actions cancel

indexer indexer actions approve 1 3 5

indexer indexer actions execute approve
```

Note that supported action types for allocation management have different input requirements:

- `Allocate` - allocate stake to a specific subgraph deployment

  - 所需的操作参数：
    - deploymentID
    - amount

- `Unallocate` - close allocation, freeing up the stake to reallocate elsewhere

  - 所需的操作参数：
    - 分配ID
    - deploymentID
  - 可选操作参数：
    - poi
    - force (forces using the provided POI even if it doesn’t match what the graph-node provides)

- `Reallocate` - atomically close allocation and open a fresh allocation for the same subgraph deployment

  - 所需的操作参数：
    - 分配ID
    - deploymentID
    - amount
  - 可选操作参数：
    - poi
    - force (forces using the provided POI even if it doesn’t match what the graph-node provides)

#### 成本模式

Cost models provide dynamic pricing for queries based on market and query attributes. The Indexer Service shares a cost model with the gateways for each subgraph for which they intend to respond to queries. The gateways, in turn, use the cost model to make Indexer selection decisions per query and to negotiate payment with chosen Indexers.

#### Agora

Agora 语言提供了一种灵活的格式来声明查询的成本模型。 Agora 价格模型是一系列的语句，它们按照 GraphQL 查询中每个顶层查询的顺序执行。 对于每个顶层查询，第一个与其匹配的语句决定了该查询的价格。

语句由一个用于匹配 GraphQL 查询的谓词和一个成本表达式组成，该表达式在评估时输出一个以十进制 GRT 表示的成本。 查询的命名参数位置中的值可以在谓词中捕获并在表达式中使用。 也可以在表达式中设置全局，并代替占位符。

Example cost model:

```
# This statement captures the skip value,
# uses a boolean expression in the predicate to match specific queries that use `skip`
# and a cost expression to calculate the cost based on the `skip` value and the SYSTEM_LOAD global
query { pairs(skip: $skip) { id } } when $skip > 2000 => 0.0001 * $skip * $SYSTEM_LOAD;

# This default will match any GraphQL expression.
# It uses a Global substituted into the expression to calculate cost
default => 0.1 * $SYSTEM_LOAD;
```

Example query costing using the above model:

| 询问                                                                           | 价格      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| &#123; pairs(skip: 5000) &#123; id &#125; &#125;                             | 0.5 GRT |
| &#123; tokens &#123; symbol &#125; &#125;                                    | 0.1 GRT |
| &#123; pairs(skip: 5000) &#123; id &#123; tokens &#125; symbol &#125; &#125; | 0.6 GRT |

#### 应用成本模式

成本模型是通过索引人 CLI 应用的，CLI 将它们传递给索引人代理的索引人管理 API，以便存储在数据库中。 然后，索引人服务将接收这些模型，并在网关要求时将成本模型提供给它们。

```sh
indexer cost set variables '{ "SYSTEM_LOAD": 1.4 }'
indexer cost set model my_model.agora
```

## 与网络的交互

### 在协议中进行质押

The first steps to participating in the network as an Indexer are to approve the protocol, stake funds, and (optionally) set up an operator address for day-to-day protocol interactions. _ **Note**: For the purposes of these instructions Remix will be used for contract interaction, but feel free to use your tool of choice ([OneClickDapp](https://oneclickdapp.com/), [ABItopic](https://abitopic.io/), and [MyCrypto](https://www.mycrypto.com/account) are a few other known tools)._

Once an Indexer has staked GRT in the protocol, the [Indexer components](/network/indexing#indexer-components) can be started up and begin their interactions with the network.

#### Approve tokens

1. Open the [Remix app](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in a browser

2. 使用[token ABI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphprotocol/contracts/mainnet-deploy-build/build/abis/GraphToken.json).在`File Explorer`文件夹中创建一个名为**GraphToken.abi**的文件。

3. With `GraphToken.abi` selected and open in the editor, switch to the Deploy and `Run Transactions` section in the Remix interface.

4. Under environment select `Injected Web3` and under `Account` select your Indexer address.

5. Set the GraphToken contract address - Paste the GraphToken contract address (`0xc944E90C64B2c07662A292be6244BDf05Cda44a7`) next to `At Address` and click the `At address` button to apply.

6. Call the `approve(spender, amount)` function to approve the Staking contract. Fill in `spender` with the Staking contract address (`0xF55041E37E12cD407ad00CE2910B8269B01263b9`) and `amount` with the tokens to stake (in wei).

#### 质押代币

1. Open the [Remix app](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in a browser

2. 在 `File Explorer` 创建一个名为**Staking.abi** 的文件中，使用 staking ABI.

3. With `Staking.abi` selected and open in the editor, switch to the `Deploy` and `Run Transactions` section in the Remix interface.

4. Under environment select `Injected Web3` and under `Account` select your Indexer address.

5. Set the Staking contract address - Paste the Staking contract address (`0xF55041E37E12cD407ad00CE2910B8269B01263b9`) next to `At Address` and click the `At address` button to apply.

6. Call `stake()` to stake GRT in the protocol.

7. (Optional) Indexers may approve another address to be the operator for their Indexer infrastructure in order to separate the keys that control the funds from those that are performing day to day actions such as allocating on subgraphs and serving (paid) queries. In order to set the operator call `setOperator()` with the operator address.

8. (Optional) In order to control the distribution of rewards and strategically attract Delegators Indexers can update their delegation parameters by updating their indexingRewardCut (parts per million), queryFeeCut (parts per million), and cooldownBlocks (number of blocks). To do so call `setDelegationParameters()`. The following example sets the queryFeeCut to distribute 95% of query rebates to the Indexer and 5% to Delegators, set the indexingRewardCutto distribute 60% of indexing rewards to the Indexer and 40% to Delegators, and set `thecooldownBlocks` period to 500 blocks.

```
setDelegationParameters(950000, 600000, 500)
```

### 分配的生命周期

After being created by an Indexer a healthy allocation goes through four states.

- **Active** - Once an allocation is created on-chain ([allocateFrom()](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/master/contracts/staking/Staking.sol#L873)) it is considered **active**. A portion of the Indexer's own and/or delegated stake is allocated towards a subgraph deployment, which allows them to claim indexing rewards and serve queries for that subgraph deployment. The Indexer agent manages creating allocations based on the Indexer rules.

- **Closed** - An Indexer is free to close an allocation once 1 epoch has passed ([closeAllocation()](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/master/contracts/staking/Staking.sol#L873)) or their Indexer agent will automatically close the allocation after the **maxAllocationEpochs** (currently 28 days). When an allocation is closed with a valid proof of indexing (POI) their indexing rewards are distributed to the Indexer and its Delegators (see "how are rewards distributed?" below to learn more).

- **Finalized** - Once an allocation has been closed there is a dispute period after which the allocation is considered **finalized** and it's query fee rebates are available to be claimed (claim()). The Indexer agent monitors the network to detect **finalized** allocations and claims them if they are above a configurable (and optional) threshold, **—-allocation-claim-threshold**.

- **Claimed** - The final state of an allocation; it has run its course as an active allocation, all eligible rewards have been distributed and its query fee rebates have been claimed.

建议索引人在链上创建分配之前，利用链外同步功能将子图部署同步到链头。对于可能需要超过28个时期才能同步或有一些无法确定失败的机会的子图，此功能特别有用。
