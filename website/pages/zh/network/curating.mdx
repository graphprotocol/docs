Curators are critical to The Graph's decentralized economy. They use their knowledge of the web3 ecosystem to assess and signal on the subgraphs that should be indexed by The Graph Network. Through Graph Explorer, Curators view network data to make signaling decisions. In turn, The Graph Network rewards Curators who signal on good quality subgraphs with a share of the query fees those subgraphs generate. The amount of GRT signaled is one of the key considerations for indexers when determining which subgraphs to index.

## What Does Signaling Mean for The Graph Network?

Before consumers can query a subgraph, it must be indexed. This is where curation comes into play. In order for Indexers to earn substantial query fees on quality subgraphs, they need to know what subgraphs to index. When Curators signal on a subgraph, it lets Indexers know that a subgraph is in demand and of sufficient quality that it should be indexed.

Curators make The Graph network efficient and [signaling](#how-to-signal) is the process that Curators use to let Indexers know that a subgraph is good to index. Indexers can trust the signal from a Curator because upon signaling, Curators mint a curation share for the subgraph, entitling them to a portion of future query fees that the subgraph drives.

Curator signals are represented as ERC20 tokens called Graph Curation Shares (GCS). Those that want to earn more query fees should signal their GRT to subgraphs that they predict will generate a strong flow of fees to the network. Curators cannot be slashed for bad behavior, but there is a deposit tax on Curators to disincentivize poor decision-making that could harm the integrity of the network. Curators will also earn fewer query fees if they curate on a low-quality subgraph because there will be fewer queries to process or fewer Indexers to process them.

The [Sunrise Upgrade Indexer](/sunrise/#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) ensures the indexing of all subgraphs, signaling GRT on a particular subgraph will draw more indexers to it. This incentivization of additional Indexers through curation aims to enhance the quality of service for queries by reducing latency and enhancing network availability.

When signaling, Curators can decide to signal on a specific version of the subgraph or to signal using auto-migrate. If they signal using auto-migrate, a curator’s shares will always be updated to the latest version published by the developer. If they decide to signal on a specific version instead, shares will always stay on this specific version.

If you require assistance with curation to enhance the quality of service, please send a request to the Edge & Node team at support@thegraph.zendesk.com and specify the subgraphs you need assistance with.

Indexers can find subgraphs to index based on curation signals they see in Graph Explorer (screenshot below).

## 如何进行信号处理

Within the Curator tab in Graph Explorer, curators will be able to signal and unsignal on certain subgraphs based on network stats. For a step-by-step overview of how to do this in Graph Explorer, [click here.](/network/explorer)

策展人可以选择在特定的子图版本上发出信号，或者他们可以选择让他们的策展份额自动迁移到该子图的最新生产版本。 这两种策略都是有效的，都有各自的优点和缺点。

Signaling on a specific version is especially useful when one subgraph is used by multiple dapps. One dapp might need to regularly update the subgraph with new features. Another dapp might prefer to use an older, well-tested subgraph version. Upon initial curation, a 1% standard tax is incurred.

让你的策展份额自动迁移到最新的生产构建，对确保你不断累积查询费用是有价值的。 每次你策展时，都会产生 1%的策展税。 每次迁移时，你也将支付 0.5%的策展税。 不鼓励子图开发人员频繁发布新版本--他们必须为所有自动迁移的策展份额支付 0.5%的策展税。

> **Note**: The first address to signal a particular subgraph is considered the first curator and will have to do much more gas-intensive work than the rest of the following curators because the first curator initializes the curation share tokens, and also transfers tokens into The Graph proxy.

## Withdrawing your GRT

Curators have the option to withdraw their signaled GRT at any time.

Unlike the process of delegating, if you decide to withdraw your signaled GRT you will not have to wait for a cooldown period and will receive the entire amount (minus the 1% curation tax).

Once a curator withdraws their signal, indexers may choose to keep indexing the subgraph, even if there's currently no active GRT signaled.

However, it is recommended that curators leave their signaled GRT in place not only to receive a portion of the query fees, but also to ensure reliability and uptime of the subgraph.

## 风险

1. 在Graph，查询市场本来就很年轻，由于市场动态刚刚开始，你的年收益率可能低于你的预期，这是有风险的。
2. Curation Fee - when a curator signals GRT on a subgraph, they incur a 1% curation tax. This fee is burned.
3. (Ethereum only) When curators burn their shares to withdraw GRT, the GRT valuation of the remaining shares will be reduced. Be aware that in some cases, curators may decide to burn their shares **all at once**. This situation may be common if a dapp developer stops versioning/improving and querying their subgraph or if a subgraph fails. As a result, remaining curators might only be able to withdraw a fraction of their initial GRT. For a network role with a lower risk profile, see [Delegators](/network/delegating).
4. 一个子图可能由于错误而失败。 一个失败的子图不会累积查询费用。 因此，你必须等待，直到开发人员修复错误并部署一个新的版本。
   - 如果你订阅了一个子图的最新版本，你的份额将自动迁移到该新版本。 这将产生 0.5%的策展税。
   - If you have signaled on a specific subgraph version and it fails, you will have to manually burn your curation shares. You can then signal on the new subgraph version, thus incurring a 1% curation tax.

## 策展常见问题

### 1. 策展人能赚取多少百分比的查询费？

By signalling on a subgraph, you will earn a share of all the query fees that the subgraph generates. 10% of all query fees go to the Curators pro-rata to their curation shares. This 10% is subject to governance.

### 2. 如何决定哪些子图是高质量的信号？

Finding high-quality subgraphs is a complex task, but it can be approached in many different ways. As a Curator, you want to look for trustworthy subgraphs that are driving query volume. A trustworthy subgraph may be valuable if it is complete, accurate, and supports a dapp’s data needs. A poorly architected subgraph might need to be revised or re-published, and can also end up failing. It is critical for Curators to review a subgraph’s architecture or code in order to assess if a subgraph is valuable. As a result:

- Curators can use their understanding of a network to try and predict how an individual subgraph may generate a higher or lower query volume in the future
- Curators should also understand the metrics that are available through Graph Explorer. Metrics like past query volume and who the subgraph developer is can help determine whether or not a subgraph is worth signalling on.

### 3. 升级一个子图的成本是多少？

Migrating your curation shares to a new subgraph version incurs a curation tax of 1%. Curators can choose to subscribe to the newest version of a subgraph. When curator shares get auto-migrated to a new version, Curators will also pay half curation tax, ie. 0.5%, because upgrading subgraphs is an on-chain action that costs gas.

### 4. 我可以多频繁的升级子图？

建议你不要太频繁地升级子图。 更多细节请见上面的问题。

### 5. 我可以出售我的策展份额吗？

Curation shares cannot be "bought" or "sold" like other ERC20 tokens that you may be familiar with. They can only be minted (created) or burned (destroyed).

As a Curator on Arbitrum, you are guaranteed to get back the GRT you initially deposited (minus the tax).

### 6. Am I eligible for a curation grant?

Curation grants are determined individually on a case-by-case basis. If you need assistance with curation, please send a request to support@thegraph.zendesk.com.
