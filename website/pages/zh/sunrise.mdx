## What is the Sunrise of Decentralized Data?

The Sunrise of Decentralized Data is an initiative spearheaded by Edge & Node. The goal is to enable subgraph developers to seamlessly upgrade to The Graph’s decentralized network.

这一计划借鉴了 The Graph 生态系统的许多先前的发展，包括升级索引人以提供对新发布子图的查询服务，以及将新的区块链网络集成到 The Graph 中的能力。

### What are the phases of the Sunrise?

**Sunray**: Enable support for hosted service chains, introduce a seamless upgrade flow, offer a free plan on The Graph Network as well as simple payment options.\
**Sunbeam**: The upgrade window that subgraph developers will have to upgrade their hosted service subgraphs to The Graph Network. This window will end on June 12th 2024.\
**Sunrise**: Hosted service endpoints will no longer be available after June 12th 2024.

## Upgrading subgraphs to The Graph Network

### When will hosted service subgraphs no longer be available?

Hosted service subgraphs will no longer be available after June 12th, 2024 (the cutoff date). Developers will no longer be able to deploy new versions, and query endpoints will no longer be available to query, returning an error message explaining what to do next.

### Will my hosted service subgraph be supported on The Graph Network?

Yes, the upgrade Indexer will automatically support all hosted service subgraphs published to The Graph Network for a seamless upgrade experience.

### How do I upgrade my hosted service subgraph?

> Note: Upgrading a subgraph to The Graph Network cannot be undone.

<VideoEmbed youtube="hCmX5Dlhdjw" />

To upgrade a hosted service subgraph, you can visit the subgraph dashboard on the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service).

1. Select the subgraph(s) you want to upgrade.
2. Select the receiving wallet (the wallet that will become the owner of the subgraph).
3. Click the "Upgrade" button.

Once your subgraph is published, the [upgrade Indexer](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) will begin serving queries on it, so you can begin making queries immediately, once you have generated an API key ([learn more](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph/#what-next)).

### How can I get support with the upgrade process?

The Graph community is here to support developers as they move to The Graph Network. Join The Graph's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) and request help in the #upgrade-decentralized-network channel.

### How can I ensure high quality of service and redundancy for subgraphs on The Graph Network?

All subgraphs will be supported by the upgrade indexer. Developers can add GRT signal to Subgraphs eligible for indexing rewards in order to attract additional Indexers, for redundancy and improved quality of service ([learn more about adding signal to your subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph))

Subgraphs which are not eligible for indexing rewards may have difficulty attracting further Indexers. For example, indexing rewards may not be available for subgraphs on certain chains (check support [here](/developing/supported-networks)).

Members from these blockchain communities are encouraged to integrate their chain through the [Chain Integration Process](/chain-integration-overview/).

### How do I publish new versions to the network?

You can deploy new versions of your subgraph directly to Subgraph Studio, which provides a testing environment, before publishing to the network for production usage. Subgraph Studio has a different deployment command to the , and requires a `version-label` for each new deployment.

1. Upgrade to the latest version of [graph-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
2. Update your deploy command

```sh
# Authorize with Subgraph Studio, available on your subgraph page
## Alternativel pass this into the deploy command as --access-token (see below)
graph auth --studio <deploy-key>

# Deploy to Subgraph Studio
## Unlike the hosted service, the name is just the subgraph name (no github id)
## If using `--node` directly, you can pass in https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
graph deploy --studio --version <version> --access-token <deploy-key> <subgraph-name>
```

This new version will then sync in Subgraph Studio, a testing and sandbox environment. When you are ready to move a new version to production, you can [publish the subgraph version](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph).

> Publishing requires Arbitrum ETH - upgrading your subgraph also airdrops a small amount to facilitate your first protocol interactions 🧑‍🚀

### What happens if I don't upgrade my subgraph?

Subgraphs will be queryable on the hosted service until the cutoff date, after which query endpoints will no longer be available, and owners will not be able to deploy new versions. Owners will still be able to simply upgrade their subgraphs to the network at any time, even after the cutoff date.

### I use a subgraph developed by someone else, how can I make sure that my service isn't interrupted?

When the owner has upgraded their subgraph, you will be able to easily go from the subgraph's Hosted Service page to the corresponding subgraph on The Graph Network, and update your application to use the new subgraph's query URL ([learn more](querying/querying-the-graph)).

Around the start of June, Edge & Node will automatically upgrade actively queried subgraphs. This will give any third party data consumers an opportunity to move to the new Network subgraph endpoints before the cutoff date. The subgraph owners will still be able to “claim” these subgraphs on the network using the Hosted Service upgrade flow.

### How can I get started querying subgraphs on The Graph Network?

You can explore available subgraphs on [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer). [Learn more about querying subgraphs on The Graph](/querying/querying-the-graph).

## About the Upgrade Indexer

### What is the upgrade Indexer?

The upgrade Indexer is designed to improve the experience of upgrading subgraphs from the hosted service to The Graph Network and supporting new versions of existing subgraphs that have not yet been indexed.

升级索引人旨在启动尚未在网络上具有索引奖励的链，并作为新子图版本的备用选择。其目标是确保在子图发布后尽快提供索引人来响应查询。

### What chains does the upgrade Indexer support?

The upgrade Indexer supports chains that were previously only available on the hosted service.

请在[此处](/developing/supported-networks/) 查找支持的链的综合列表。

### 为什么 Edge & Node 运行升级索引人？

Edge and Node 历史上一直维护托管服务，因此已同步了托管服务子图的数据。

鼓励任何索引人都成为升级索引人。然而，需要注意的是，运行升级索引人主要是作为一项公共服务提供的，旨在支持新的子图和额外的链，因为在它们获得 The Graph Council 批准之前，缺乏索引奖励。

### What does the upgrade indexer mean for existing Indexers?

Chains that were previously exclusively supported on the hosted service are available to developers on The Graph without indexing rewards at first, though this does unlock query fees for any Indexer that is interested. This is expected to lead to an increase in the number of subgraphs being published on the network, providing more opportunities for Indexers to index and serve these subgraphs in return for query fees, even before indexing rewards are enabled for a chain.

升级索引人还向索引人社区提供关于 The Graph Network 上潜在的子图需求和新链的信息。

### 这对于委托人来说意味着什么？

升级索引人为代币委托人提供了强大的机会。随着越来越多的子图从托管服务迁移到 The Graph Network，委托人将从增加的网络活动中获益。

### 升级索引人会与现有的索引人竞争奖励吗？

不，升级索引人只会为每个子图分配最低金额，并不会收集索引奖励。

它根据“根据需要”的方式运行，并作为网络中至少有3个其他索引人为各自的链和子图实现足够的服务质量之前的备用。

### 这将如何影响子图开发者？

Subgraph developers will be able to query their subgraphs on the network almost immediately after upgrading from the hosted service or publishing from Subgraph Studio, as no lead time will be required for indexing.

### 这如何使数据消费者受益？

The upgrade Indexer enables chains on the network that were previously only supported on the hosted service. Therefore, it widens the scope and availability of data that can be queried on the network.

### 升级的索引人将如何定价查询？

升级的索引人将按市场价格定价查询，以不影响查询费用市场。

### 升级索引人停止支持一个子图的标准是什么？

升级的索引人将为一个子图提供服务，直到它能够获得由至少3个其他索引人提供的持续且成功的查询服务。

此外，如果一个子图在过去的30天内没有被查询，升级的索引人将停止支持该子图。

其他索引人会被激励来支持有持续查询量的子图，因此升级的索引人的查询量应该趋近于零，因为该索引人的分配容量较小，其他索引人将在升级的索引人之前被选中进行查询。

## About The Graph Network

### 我需要自己运行基础设施吗？

No, all infrastructure is operated by independent Indexers on The Graph Network, including the upgrade Indexer ([read more below](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer)).

You can use the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to create, test, and publish your subgraph. All hosted service users must upgrade their subgraph to The Graph Network before the end of the upgrade window ending on June 12th 2024.

The upgrade Indexer ensures you can query your subgraph even without curation signal.

一旦您的子图达到足够的策展信号，并且其他索引人开始支持它，那么升级索引人将逐渐减少，这将允许其他索引人收集索引奖励和查询费用。

### 我应该自己托管索引基础设施吗？

与使用The Graph Network相比，为您自己的项目运行基础设施需要的资源明显更多(/network/benefits/)。

此外，与单一组织或团队提供的任何内容相比，The Graph Network显著更健壮、可靠和成本效益更高。全球数百个独立的指标化者支持The Graph Network，确保了安全性、可靠性和冗余性。

话虽如此，如果您仍有兴趣运行[Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node)，考虑加入The Graph Network，作为索引人，通过为您的子图和其他子图提供数据来赚取索引奖励和查询费用。了解如何成为索引人的更多信息，请参阅[此链接](https://thegraph.com/blog/how-to-become-indexer/)。

### 我应该使用中心化的索引提供者吗？

如果您正在构建Web3应用程序，一旦使用中心化的索引提供者，您将把对您的DApp和数据的控制交给他们。The Graph的分散网络提供卓越的服务质量、通过节点冗余实现无与伦比的可用性，以及显著更低的成本，您将不会受到数据层的威胁。了解更多关于[服务质量](https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/)和[网络优势](/network/benefits/)的信息。

在The Graph Network上，您的子图是公开的，任何人都可以公开查询它，这会增加您DApp的使用率和网络效应。而使用中心化的索引解决方案，子图对中心化提供者来说是私有的。

Additionally, the upgrade Indexer enables 100,000 free monthly queries for your subgraph before needing to pay for queries.

以下是The Graph相对于中心化托管的好处的详细分析：

- **弹性与冗余性**：分散系统因其分布式性质而本质上更加坚固和弹性十足。数据不存储在单一服务器或位置上，而是由全球数百个独立的索引人提供。这降低了数据丢失或服务中断的风险，即使一个节点失败，也能实现卓越的可用性（99.99%）。

- **服务质量**：除了令人印象深刻的可用性之外，The Graph Network具有约106毫秒的中位查询速度（延迟），以及相对于托管的替代方案，更高的查询成功率。更多信息请参阅[此博客](https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/)。

- **Censorship Resistance**: Centralized systems are targets for censorship, either through regulatory pressures or network attacks. In contrast, decentralized systems, due to their dispersed architecture, are much harder to censor, ensuring continuous data availability.

- **透明度和信任**：分散系统开放运行，使任何人都能独立验证数据。这种透明性在网络参与者之间建立了信任，因为他们可以验证系统的完整性，而无需依赖中央权威。

正如您选择区块链网络以获取分散性、安全性和透明性一样，选择The Graph Network是这些相同原则的延伸。通过将您的数据基础设施与这些价值观保持一致，您确保了一个有凝聚力、弹性十足且以信任为驱动的开发环境。
