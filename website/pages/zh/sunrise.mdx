### What are the phases of the Sunrise?

**Sunray**: Enable support for hosted service chains, introduce a seamless upgrade flow, offer a free plan on The Graph Network, and provide simple payment options.\
**Sunbeam**: The upgrade window that subgraph developers will have to upgrade their hosted service subgraphs to The Graph Network. This window will end at 10 a.m. PT on June 12th 2024.\
**Sunrise**: Hosted service endpoints will no longer be available after 10 a.m. PT on June 12th, 2024.

## Upgrading subgraphs to The Graph Network

### When will hosted service subgraphs no longer be available?

Hosted service query endpoints will remain active until 10 a.m. PT on June 12th. After June 12th at 10 a.m. PT, query endpoints will no longer be available, and developers will no longer be able to deploy new subgraph versions on the hosted service.

### I didn‚Äôt upgrade my subgraph by June 12th at 10 a.m. PT. What should I do if I still want to use it?

The hosted service homepage is still accessible and can be used to search for legacy hosted service subgraphs. If your hosted service subgraph has already been auto-upgraded, you may claim its network equivalent as the original owner. If your subgraph was not [auto-upgraded subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/blog/unveiling-updated-sunrise-decentralized-data/#phase-2-sunbeam), you can still upgrade and publish it.

Upgrading takes less than five minutes on average. Once your subgraph is up, simply set up an API key in Subgraph Studio, update your API query endpoint, and begin querying!

### Will my hosted service subgraph be supported on The Graph Network?

Yes, the upgrade Indexer will automatically support all hosted service subgraphs published to The Graph Network for a seamless upgrade experience.

### How do I upgrade my hosted service subgraph?

> Note: Upgrading a subgraph to The Graph Network cannot be undone.

<VideoEmbed youtube="hCmX5Dlhdjw" />

To upgrade a hosted service subgraph, you can visit the subgraph dashboard on the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service).

1. Select the subgraph(s) you want to upgrade.
2. Select the receiving wallet (the wallet that will become the owner of the subgraph).
3. Click the "Upgrade" button.

Once your subgraph is published, the [upgrade Indexer](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) will begin serving queries on it. Once you have generated an API key, you can begin making queries immediately. [Learn more](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph/#what-next).

### How can I get support with the upgrade process?

The Graph community is here to support developers as they move to The Graph Network. Join The Graph's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) and request help in the #upgrade-decentralized-network channel.

### How can I ensure high quality of service and redundancy for subgraphs on The Graph Network?

All subgraphs will be supported by the upgrade Indexer. For a higher quality of service and more robust redundancy, you can add a curation signal to subgraphs eligible for indexing rewards. It is recommended that you curate your subgraph with at least 3000 GRT (per subgraph) to attract about 3 Indexers. [Learn more about adding signal to your subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph).

Please note that this indexing incentive does not deplete over time; it has no depletion rate and is instantly withdrawable at any time. If you want to add 3000 GRT in signal, you will need to signal 3030 GRT (as 1% would be burned). Note that a 0.5% fee is also deducted from the subgraph‚Äôs signal every time a new version is published.

Subgraphs which are not eligible for indexing rewards may struggle to attract further Indexers. For example, indexing rewards may not be available for subgraphs on certain chains (check support [here](/developing/supported-networks)).

Members from these blockchain communities are encouraged to integrate their chain through the [Chain Integration Process](/chain-integration-overview/).

### How do I publish new versions to the network?

You can deploy new versions of your subgraph directly to Subgraph Studio, which provides a testing environment, before publishing to the network for production usage. Subgraph Studio has a different deployment command and requires a `version-label` for each new deployment.

1. Upgrade to the latest version of [graph-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
2. Update your deploy command

```sh
#¬†Authorize with Subgraph Studio, available on your subgraph page
## Alternativel pass this into the deploy command as --access-token (see below)
graph auth --studio <deploy-key>

# Deploy to Subgraph Studio
## Unlike the hosted service, the name is just the subgraph name (no github id)
## If using `--node` directly, you can pass in https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
graph deploy --studio --version <version> --access-token <deploy-key> <subgraph-name>
```

This new version will then sync in Subgraph Studio, a testing and sandbox environment. When you are ready to move a new version to production, you can [publish the subgraph version](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph).

> Publishing requires Arbitrum ETH - upgrading your subgraph also airdrops a small amount to facilitate your first protocol interactions üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

### I use a subgraph developed by someone else, how can I make sure that my service isn't interrupted?

When the owner has upgraded their subgraph, you will be able to easily go from the subgraph's hosted service page to the corresponding subgraph on The Graph Network, and update your application to use the new subgraph's query URL. [Learn more](/querying/querying-the-graph).

Around the start of June, Edge & Node will automatically upgrade actively queried subgraphs. This will give any third-party data consumers an opportunity to move subgraph endpoints to The Graph Network before 10 a.m. on June 12th. The subgraph owners will still be able to claim these subgraphs on the network using the hosted service upgrade flow.

### My subgraph has been auto-upgraded, what does that mean?

Subgraphs on the hosted service are open APIs, and many subgraphs are relied upon by third-party developers to build their applications. To give those developers sufficient time to move to The Graph Network, Edge & Node will be "auto-upgrading" highly used subgraphs. A link to the "auto-upgraded" subgraph will be visible on the original subgraph's page on the hosted service.

Owners of "auto-upgraded" subgraphs can easily claim their upgraded subgraphs using the same [upgrade flow](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph) - such subgraphs can be identified by their "auto-upgraded" tag. Ownership of the subgraph on The Graph Network will be transferred to the owner's wallet.

### My subgraph has been auto-upgraded, but I need to deploy a new version

You can use the [upgrade flow](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph) to claim the auto-upgraded subgraph, and then you can deploy a new version in Subgraph Studio, using the same infrastructure that powers the hosted service.

If you require an urgent fix, please contact support.

### What happens if I don't upgrade my subgraph?

Subgraphs will be queryable on the hosted service until 10 a.m. PT on June 12th. After this date, the hosted service homepage will still be accessible, however, query endpoints will no longer be available. Owners of hosted service subgraphs will still be able to upgrade their subgraphs to The Graph Network after June 12th, though earlier upgrades are entitled to [earn rewards](https://thegraph.com/sunrise-upgrade-program/). Developers will also be able to claim [auto-upgraded subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/blog/unveiling-updated-sunrise-decentralized-data/#phase-2-sunbeam).

### What should I do with my subgraphs on the hosted service? Will they stop working and should I delete them?

It is not possible to delete subgraphs. Query endpoints will remain active until 10 a.m. PT on June 12th, regardless of whether they have been upgraded or not.

### Will Subgraph Studio be impacted by this upgrade?

No, Subgraph Studio will not be impacted by Sunrise.

### What will happen to the hosted service?

After 10 a.m. PT on June 12th, query endpoints will no longer be available, and owners won't be able to deploy or query the hosted service. However, the hosted service UI will still show subgraph pages, and subgraph owners will be able to upgrade their subgraphs if they haven't already. The hosted service UI will be retired at a later date.

### Will subgraphs need to be re-indexed again?

No, rest assured that your subgraph will not need to be re-indexed when it is upgraded to The Graph Network. Subgraphs will be immediately available for querying, powered by the upgrade Indexer, which uses the same infrastructure as the hosted service. If your subgraph is indexing a network that is eligible for indexing rewards, you can add signal to attract indexers. [Learn more about adding signal to your subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph).

### I‚Äôm experiencing indexing issues. What should I do?

Rest assured that network Indexers are prepared to provide support during this upgrade. If you experience issues with any of your subgraph queries, please reach out to support@thegraph.zendesk.com

### Why is my subgraph being published to Arbitrum, is it indexing a different network?

The Graph Network was originally deployed on mainnet Ethereum but moved to Arbitrum One to reduce gas costs for all users. As such any new subgraphs are published to The Graph Network on Arbitrum so that they can be supported by Indexers. Arbitrum is the network that subgraphs are published to, but subgraphs can index any of the [supported networks](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/supported-networks/)

### How can I get started querying subgraphs on The Graph Network?

You can explore available subgraphs on [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer). [Learn more about querying subgraphs on The Graph](/querying/querying-the-graph).

## About the Upgrade Indexer

### What is the upgrade Indexer?

The upgrade Indexer is designed to improve the experience of upgrading subgraphs from the hosted service to The Graph Network and to support new versions of existing subgraphs that have not yet been indexed.

The upgrade Indexer aims to bootstrap chains that don't have indexing rewards yet on The Graph Network and to serve as a fallback for new subgraph versions. The goal is to ensure that an Indexer is available to serve queries as quickly as possible after a subgraph is published.

### What chains does the upgrade Indexer support?

The upgrade Indexer supports chains that were previously only available on the hosted service.

ËØ∑Âú®[Ê≠§Â§Ñ](/developing/supported-networks/) Êü•ÊâæÊîØÊåÅÁöÑÈìæÁöÑÁªºÂêàÂàóË°®„ÄÇ

### ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πà Edge & Node ËøêË°åÂçáÁ∫ßÁ¥¢Âºï‰∫∫Ôºü

Edge & Node has historically maintained the hosted service and, as a result, has already synced data for hosted service subgraphs.

All Indexers are encouraged to become upgrade Indexers as well. However, note that operating an upgrade Indexer is primarily a public service to support new subgraphs and additional chains that lack indexing rewards before they are approved by The Graph Council.

### What does the upgrade indexer mean for existing Indexers?

Chains that were previously only supported on the hosted service will now be available to developers on The Graph Network without indexing rewards at first, but it will unlock query fees for any Indexer that is interested. This should lead to an increase in the number of subgraphs being published on The Graph Network, providing more opportunities for Indexers to index and serve these subgraphs in return for query fees, even before indexing rewards are enabled for a chain.

It operates on an ‚Äúas needed‚Äù basis and serves as a fallback until sufficient service quality is achieved by at least 3 other Indexers in the network for respective chains and subgraphs.

### ËøôÂ∞ÜÂ¶Ç‰ΩïÂΩ±ÂìçÂ≠êÂõæÂºÄÂèëËÄÖÔºü

Subgraph developers will be able to query their subgraphs on The Graph Network almost immediately after upgrading from the hosted service or publishing from Subgraph Studio, as no lead time will be required for indexing.

Other Indexers are incentivized to support subgraphs with ongoing query volume. The query volume to the upgrade Indexer should trend towards zero, as it will have a small allocation size, and other Indexers will be chosen for queries ahead of it.

## About The Graph Network

### ÊàëÈúÄË¶ÅËá™Â∑±ËøêË°åÂü∫Á°ÄËÆæÊñΩÂêóÔºü

No, all infrastructure is operated by independent Indexers on The Graph Network, including the upgrade Indexer ([read more below](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer)).

You can use [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to create, test, and publish your subgraph. All hosted service users must upgrade their subgraph to The Graph Network before 10 a.m. PT on June 12th, 2024.

The [Sunrise Upgrade Indexer](/sunrise/#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) ensures the indexing of all subgraphs. However, signaling GRT on a particular subgraph will draw more indexers to it. This incentivization of additional Indexers through curation aims to enhance the quality of service for queries by reducing latency and enhancing network availability.

When signaling, Curators can decide to signal on a specific version of the subgraph or to signal using auto-migrate. If they signal using auto-migrate, a curator‚Äôs shares will always be updated to the latest version published by the developer. If they decide to signal on a specific version instead, shares will always stay on that specific version.

To assist teams that are transitioning subgraphs from the hosted service to the Graph Network, curation support is now available. If you require assistance with curation to enhance the quality of service, please send a request to the Edge & Node team at support@thegraph.zendesk.com and specify the subgraphs you need assistance with.

If you are building in web3, the moment you use a centralized indexing provider, you are giving them control of your dapp and data. The Graph‚Äôs decentralized network offers [superior quality of service](https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/), reliability with unbeatable uptime thanks to node redundancy, significantly [lower costs](/network/benefits/), and keeps you from being hostage at the data layer.

With The Graph Network, your subgraph is public and anyone can query it openly, which increases the usage and network effects of your dapp.

Additionally, Subgraph Studio provides 100,000 free monthly queries on the Free Plan, before payment is needed for additional usage.

- **Censorship Resistance**: Centralized systems are targets for censorship, either through regulatory pressures or network attacks. In contrast, the dispersed architecture of decentralized systems makes them much harder to censor, which ensures continuous data availability.

- **Transparency and Trust**: Decentralized systems operate openly, enabling anyone to independently verify the data. This transparency builds trust among network participants because they can verify the system's integrity without relying on a central authority.
