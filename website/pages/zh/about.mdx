本页将解释什么是 Graph，以及你如何开始。

## What is The Graph?

The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. The Graph makes it possible to query data that is difficult to query directly.

像 [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)这样具有复杂智能合约的项目，以及像 [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) 这样的 NFTs 倡议，都在以太坊区块链上存储数据，因此，除了直接从区块链上读取基本数据外，真的很难。

在 Bored Ape Yacht Club 的案例中，我们可以对 [合约](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d#code)进行基本的读取操作，比如获得某个 Ape 的所有者，根据他们的 ID 获得某个 Ape 的内容 URI，或者总供应量，因为这些读取操作是直接编入智能合约的，但是更高级的现实世界的查询和操作，比如聚合、搜索、关系和非粗略的过滤是不可能的。 例如，如果我们想查询某个地址所拥有的 apes，并通过它的某个特征进行过滤，我们将无法通过直接与合约本身进行交互来获得该信息。

为了获得这些数据，你必须处理曾经发出的每一个 [`传输`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d#code#L1746) 事件，使用 Token ID 和 IPFS 的 hash 值从 IPFS 读取元数据，然后将其汇总。 即使是这些类型的相对简单的问题，在浏览器中运行的去中心化应用程序（dapp）也需要**几个小时甚至几天** 才能得到答案。

You could also build out your own server, process the transactions there, save them to a database, and build an API endpoint on top of it all in order to query the data. However, this option is [resource intensive](/network/benefits/), needs maintenance, presents a single point of failure, and breaks important security properties required for decentralization.

**为区块链数据编制索引真的非常非常难。**

Blockchain properties like finality, chain reorganizations, or uncled blocks complicate this process further, and make it not just time consuming but conceptually hard to retrieve correct query results from blockchain data.

The Graph solves this with a decentralized protocol that indexes and enables the performant and efficient querying of blockchain data. These APIs (indexed "subgraphs") can then be queried with a standard GraphQL API. Today, there is a hosted service as well as a decentralized protocol with the same capabilities. Both are backed by the open source implementation of [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node).

## How The Graph Works

The Graph learns what and how to index Ethereum data based on subgraph descriptions, known as the subgraph manifest. The subgraph description defines the smart contracts of interest for a subgraph, the events in those contracts to pay attention to, and how to map event data to data that The Graph will store in its database.

Once you have written a `subgraph manifest`, you use the Graph CLI to store the definition in IPFS and tell the indexer to start indexing data for that subgraph.

This diagram gives more detail about the flow of data once a subgraph manifest has been deployed, dealing with Ethereum transactions:

流程遵循这些步骤：

1. A dapp adds data to Ethereum through a transaction on a smart contract.
2. 智能合约在处理交易时，会发出一个或多个事件。
3. Graph 节点不断扫描以太坊的新区块和它们可能包含的子图的数据。
4. Graph Node finds Ethereum events for your subgraph in these blocks and runs the mapping handlers you provided. The mapping is a WASM module that creates or updates the data entities that Graph Node stores in response to Ethereum events.
5. The dapp queries the Graph Node for data indexed from the blockchain, using the node's [GraphQL endpoint](https://graphql.org/learn/). The Graph Node in turn translates the GraphQL queries into queries for its underlying data store in order to fetch this data, making use of the store's indexing capabilities. The dapp displays this data in a rich UI for end-users, which they use to issue new transactions on Ethereum. The cycle repeats.

## 下一步

In the following sections we will go into more detail on how to define subgraphs, how to deploy them, and how to query data from the indexes that Graph Node builds.

在开始编写自己的子图之前，您可能需要查看 Graph 浏览器并探索一些已经部署的子图。每个子图的页面都包含一个操作面板，允许您使用 GraphQL 查询该子图的数据。
