title: The Graph QL Schema
---

## 概述

The schema for your subgraph is in the file `schema.graphql`. GraphQL schemas are defined using the GraphQL interface definition language.

> Note: If you've never written a GraphQL schema, it is recommended that you check out this primer on the GraphQL type system. Reference documentation for GraphQL schemas can be found in the [GraphQL API](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/) section.

### Defining Entities

Before defining entities, it is important to take a step back and think about how your data is structured and linked.

- All queries will be made against the data model defined in the subgraph schema. As a result, the design of the subgraph schema should be informed by the queries that your application will need to perform.
- It may be useful to imagine entities as "objects containing data", rather than as events or functions.
- You define entity types in `schema.graphql`, and Graph Node will generate top-level fields for querying single instances and collections of that entity type.
- Each type that should be an entity is required to be annotated with an `@entity` directive.
- By default, entities are mutable, meaning that mappings can load existing entities, modify them and store a new version of that entity.
  - Mutability comes at a price, so for entity types that will never be modified, such as those containing data extracted verbatim from the chain, it is recommended to mark them as immutable with `@entity(immutable: true)`.
  - If changes happen in the same block in which the entity was created, then mappings can make changes to immutable entities. Immutable entities are much faster to write and to query so they should be used whenever possible.

#### 好代码的例子

The following `Gravatar` entity is structured around a Gravatar object and is a good example of how an entity could be defined.

```graphql
type Gravatar @entity {
  id: Id!
  owner: Bytes
  displayName: String
  imageUrl: String
  accepted: Boolean
}
```

#### 坏榜样

The following example `GravatarAccepted` and `GravatarDeclined` entities are based around events. It is not recommended to map events or function calls to entities 1:1.

```graphql
type GravatarAccepted @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  owner: Bytes
  displayName: String
  imageUrl: String
}

type GravatarDeclined @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  owner: Bytes
  displayName: String
  imageUrl: String
}
```

#### 可选和必选字段

Entity fields can be defined as required or optional. Required fields are indicated by the `!` in the schema. If the field is a scalar field, you get an error when you try to store the entity. If the field references another entity then you get this error:

```
Null value resolved for non-null field 'name'
```

Each entity must have an `id` field, which must be of type `Bytes!` or `String!`. It is generally recommended to use `Bytes!`, unless the `id` contains human-readable text, since entities with `Bytes!` id's will be faster to write and query as those with a `String!` `id`. The `id` field serves as the primary key, and needs to be unique among all entities of the same type. For historical reasons, the type `ID!` is also accepted and is a synonym for `String!`.

For some entity types the `id` for `Bytes!` is constructed from the id's of two other entities; that is possible using `concat`, e.g., `let id = left.id.concat(right.id) ` to form the id from the id's of `left` and `right`. Similarly, to construct an id from the id of an existing entity and a counter `count`, `let id = left.id.concatI32(count)` can be used. The concatenation is guaranteed to produce unique id's as long as the length of `left` is the same for all such entities, for example, because `left.id` is an `Address`.

### 内置标量类型

#### GraphQL 支持的标量

The following scalars are supported in the GraphQL API:

| 类型 | 描述 |
| --- | --- |
| `Bytes` | 字节数组，表示为十六进制字符串。 通常用于以太坊hash和地址。 |
| `String` | Scalar for `string` values. Null characters are not supported and are automatically removed. |
| `Boolean` | Scalar for `boolean` values. |
| `Int` | The GraphQL spec defines `Int` to be a signed 32-bit integer. |
| `Int8` | An 8-byte signed integer, also known as a 64-bit signed integer, can store values in the range from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Prefer using this to represent `i64` from ethereum. |
| `BigInt` | Large integers. Used for Ethereum's `uint32`, `int64`, `uint64`, ..., `uint256` types. Note: Everything below `uint32`, such as `int32`, `uint24` or `int8` is represented as `i32`. |
| `BigDecimal` | `BigDecimal` High precision decimals represented as a significand and an exponent. The exponent range is from −6143 to +6144. Rounded to 34 significant digits. |
| `Timestamp` | It is an `i64` value in microseconds. Commonly used for `timestamp` fields for timeseries and aggregations. |

### 枚举类型

您还可以在模式中创建枚举类型。 枚举类型具有以下语法：

```graphql
enum TokenStatus {
  OriginalOwner
  SecondOwner
  ThirdOwner
}
```

Once the enum is defined in the schema, you can use the string representation of the enum value to set an enum field on an entity. For example, you can set the `tokenStatus` to `SecondOwner` by first defining your entity and subsequently setting the field with `entity.tokenStatus = "SecondOwner"`. The example below demonstrates what the Token entity would look like with an enum field:

More detail on writing enums can be found in the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/).

### 实体关系

一个实体可能与模式中的一个或多个其他实体发生联系。 您可以在您的查询中遍历这些联系。 Graph 中的联系是单向的。 可以通过在关系的任一“端”上定义单向关系来模拟双向关系。

关系是在实体上定义的，就像任何其他字段一样，除了指定的类型是另一个实体类型。

#### 一对一关系

Define a `Transaction` entity type with an optional one-to-one relationship with a `TransactionReceipt` entity type:

```graphql
type Transaction @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
  transactionReceipt: TransactionReceipt
}

type TransactionReceipt @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
  transaction: Transaction
}
```

#### 一对多关系

Define a `TokenBalance` entity type with a required one-to-many relationship with a Token entity type:

```graphql
type Token @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
}

type TokenBalance @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  amount: Int!
  token: Token!
}
```

### 反向查找

Reverse lookups can be defined on an entity through the `@derivedFrom` field. This creates a virtual field on the entity that may be queried but cannot be set manually through the mappings API. Rather, it is derived from the relationship defined on the other entity. For such relationships, it rarely makes sense to store both sides of the relationship, and both indexing and query performance will be better when only one side is stored and the other is derived.

对于一对多关系，关系应始终存储在“一”端，而“多”端应始终派生。 以这种方式存储关系，而不是在“多”端存储实体数组，将大大提高索引和查询子图的性能。 通常，应尽可能避免存储实体数组。

#### 示例

We can make the balances for a token accessible from the token by deriving a `tokenBalances` field:

```graphql
type Token @entity(immutable: true) {
  id: Bytes!
  tokenBalances: [TokenBalance!]! @derivedFrom(field: "token")
}

type TokenBalance @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  amount: Int!
  token: Token!
}
```

#### 多对多关系

对于多对多关系，例如每个可能属于任意数量的组织的用户，对关系建模的最直接，但通常不是最高效的方法，是在所涉及的两个实体中的每一个中定义数组。 如果关系是对称的，则只需要存储关系的一侧联系，就可以导出另一侧。

#### 示例

Define a reverse lookup from a `User` entity type to an `Organization` entity type. In the example below, this is achieved by looking up the `members` attribute from within the `Organization` entity. In queries, the `organizations` field on `User` will be resolved by finding all `Organization` entities that include the user's ID.

```graphql
type Organization @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  name: String!
  members: [User!]!
}

type User @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  name: String!
  organizations: [Organization!]! @derivedFrom(field: "members")
}
```

A more performant way to store this relationship is through a mapping table that has one entry for each `User` / `Organization` pair with a schema like

```graphql
type Organization @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  name: String!
  members: [UserOrganization!]! @derivedFrom(field: "organization")
}

type User @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  name: String!
  organizations: [UserOrganization!] @derivedFrom(field: "user")
}

type UserOrganization @entity {
  id: Bytes! # Set to `user.id.concat(organization.id)`
  user: User!
  organization: Organization!
}
```

这种方法要求查询下降一个额外的级别来检索，例如，用户的组织：

```graphql
query usersWithOrganizations {
  users {
    organizations {
      # this is a UserOrganization entity
      organization {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

这种存储多对多关系的更精细的方式将导致为子图存储的数据更少，因此子图的索引和查询速度通常会大大加快。

### 向模式添加注释

As per GraphQL spec, comments can be added above schema entity attributes using the hash symbol `#`. This is illustrated in the example below:

```graphql
type MyFirstEntity @entity {
  # unique identifier and primary key of the entity
  id: Bytes!
  address: Bytes!
}
```

## 定义全文搜索字段

全文搜索查询根据文本搜索输入来过滤和排列实体。 通过在与索引文本数据进行比较之前，将查询文本输入处理到词干中，全文查询能够返回相似词的匹配项。

全文查询定义包括查询名称、用于处理文本字段的语言词典、用于对结果进行排序的排序算法，以及搜索中包含的字段。 每个全文查询可能跨越多个字段，但所有包含的字段必须来自单个实体类型。

To add a fulltext query, include a `_Schema_` type with a fulltext directive in the GraphQL schema.

```graphql
type _Schema_
  @fulltext(
    name: "bandSearch"
    language: en
    algorithm: rank
    include: [{ entity: "Band", fields: [{ name: "name" }, { name: "description" }, { name: "bio" }] }]
  )

type Band @entity {
  id: Bytes!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  bio: String
  wallet: Address
  labels: [Label!]!
  discography: [Album!]!
  members: [Musician!]!
}
```

The example `bandSearch` field can be used in queries to filter `Band` entities based on the text documents in the `name`, `description`, and `bio` fields. Jump to [GraphQL API - Queries](/subgraphs/querying/graphql-api/#queries) for a description of the fulltext search API and more example usage.

```graphql
query {
  bandSearch(text: "breaks & electro & detroit") {
    id
    name
    description
    wallet
  }
}
```

> **[Feature Management](#experimental-features):** From `specVersion` `0.0.4` and onwards, `fullTextSearch` must be declared under the `features` section in the subgraph manifest.

## 支持的语言

选择不同的语言将对全文搜索 API 产生明确的（尽管有时是微妙的）影响。 全文查询字段涵盖的字段将会在所选语言的内容中进行检查，因此分析和搜索查询产生的词位因语言而异。 例如：当使用支持的土耳其语词典时，“token”的词干为“toke”，而英语词典当然会认为其词干为“token”。

支持的语言词典：

| Code   | 词典      |
| ------ | --------- |
| simple | General   |
| da     | Danish    |
| nl     | Dutch     |
| en     | English   |
| fi     | Finnish   |
| fr     | French    |
| de     | German    |
| hu     | Hungarian |
| it     | Italian   |
| no     | Norwegian |
| pt     | 葡萄牙语  |
| ro     | Romanian  |
| ru     | Russian   |
| es     | Spanish   |
| sv     | Swedish   |
| tr     | Turkish   |

### 排序算法

支持的排序结果算法：

| Algorithm     | Description                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rank          | 使用全文查询的匹配质量 (0-1) 对结果进行排序。                   |
| proximityRank | Similar to rank but also includes the proximity of the matches. |
