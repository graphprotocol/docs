title: 用嫁接替换合约并保持合约的历史
---

在本指南中，您将学习如何通过嫁接现有的子图来构建和部署新的子图。

## 什么是嫁接？

嫁接重用现有子图中的数据，并开始在稍后的区块中对其进行索引。这在开发过程中非常有用，可以快速克服映射中的简单错误，或者在现有子图失败后暂时使其重新工作。此外，当向子图添加特性时可以使用它，因为从头开始索引需要很长时间。

嫁接子图可以使用一个 GraphQL 模式 schema，该模式与基子图之一不同，但仅与基子图兼容。它本身必须是一个有效的子图模式，但是可以通过以下方式偏离基子图的模式：

- 它添加或删除实体类型
- 它从实体类型中删除属性
- 它将可为空的属性添加到实体类型
- 它将不可为空的属性转换为可空的属性
- 它将值添加到枚举类型中
- 它添加或删除接口
- 它改变了实现接口的实体类型

- [Grafting](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#grafting-onto-existing-subgraphs)

In this tutorial, we will be covering a basic use case. We will replace an existing contract with an identical contract (with a new address, but the same code). Then, graft the existing subgraph onto the "base" subgraph that tracks the new contract.

## Important Note on Grafting When Upgrading to the Network

> **Caution**: It is recommended to not use grafting for subgraphs published to The Graph Network

### Why Is This Important?

Grafting is a powerful feature that allows you to "graft" one subgraph onto another, effectively transferring historical data from the existing subgraph to a new version. It is not possible to graft a subgraph from The Graph Network back to Subgraph Studio.

### Best Practices

**Initial Migration**: when you first deploy your subgraph to the decentralized network, do so without grafting. Ensure that the subgraph is stable and functioning as expected.

**Subsequent Updates**: once your subgraph is live and stable on the decentralized network, you may use grafting for future versions to make the transition smoother and to preserve historical data.

By adhering to these guidelines, you minimize risks and ensure a smoother migration process.

## Building an Existing Subgraph

Building subgraphs is an essential part of The Graph, described more in depth [here](/subgraphs/quick-start/). To be able to build and deploy the existing subgraph used in this tutorial, the following repo is provided:

- [Subgraph example repo](https://github.com/Shiyasmohd/grafting-tutorial)

> Note: The contract used in the subgraph was taken from the following [Hackathon Starterkit](https://github.com/schmidsi/hackathon-starterkit).

## 子图清单定义

The subgraph manifest `subgraph.yaml` identifies the data sources for the subgraph, the triggers of interest, and the functions that should be run in response to those triggers. See below for an example subgraph manifest that you will use:

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.4
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
dataSources:
  - kind: ethereum
    name: Lock
    network: sepolia
    source:
      address: '0xb3aabe721794b85fe4e72134795c2f93b4eb7e63'
      abi: Lock
      startBlock: 5955690
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.6
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      entities:
        - Withdrawal
      abis:
        - name: Lock
          file: ./abis/Lock.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: Withdrawal(uint256,uint256)
          handler: handleWithdrawal
      file: ./src/lock.ts
```

- The `Lock` data source is the abi and contract address we will get when we compile and deploy the contract
- The network should correspond to an indexed network being queried. Since we're running on Sepolia testnet, the network is `sepolia`
- The `mapping` section defines the triggers of interest and the functions that should be run in response to those triggers. In this case, we are listening for the `Withdrawal` event and calling the `handleWithdrawal` function when it is emitted.

## 嫁接清单定义

嫁接需要在原始子图清单中添加两个新项:

```yaml
---
features:
  - grafting # feature name
graft:
  base: Qm... # subgraph ID of base subgraph
  block: 5956000 # block number
```

- `features:` is a list of all used [feature names](/developing/creating-a-subgraph/#experimental-features).
- `graft:` is a map of the `base` subgraph and the block to graft on to. The `block` is the block number to start indexing from. The Graph will copy the data of the base subgraph up to and including the given block and then continue indexing the new subgraph from that block on.

The `base` and `block` values can be found by deploying two subgraphs: one for the base indexing and one with grafting

## 部署基子图

1. Go to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and create a subgraph on Sepolia testnet called `graft-example`
2. Follow the directions in the `AUTH & DEPLOY` section on your subgraph page in the `graft-example` folder from the repo
3. 完成后，验证子图是否正确索引。如果在Graph Playground中运行下列指令。

```graphql
{
  withdrawals(first: 5) {
    id
    amount
    when
  }
}
```

It returns something like this:

```
{
  "data": {
    "withdrawals": [
      {
        "id": "0xe8323d21c4f104607b10b0fff9fc24b9612b9488795dea8196b2d5f980d3dc1d0a000000",
        "amount": "0",
        "when": "1716394824"
      },
      {
        "id": "0xea1cee35036f2cacb72f2a336be3e54ab911f5bebd58f23400ebb8ecc5cfc45203000000",
        "amount": "0",
        "when": "1716394848"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

一旦您验证了子图是正确的索引，您可以快速更新子图与嫁接。

## 部署嫁接子图

嫁接替代Subgraph.yaml将获得一个新的合约地址。这可能发生在更新dapp、重新部署合约等时。

1. Go to [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and create a subgraph on Sepolia testnet called `graft-replacement`
2. Create a new manifest. The `subgraph.yaml` for `graph-replacement` contains a different contract address and new information about how it should graft. These are the `block` of the [last event emitted](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xea1cee35036f2cacb72f2a336be3e54ab911f5bebd58f23400ebb8ecc5cfc452) you care about by the old contract and the `base` of the old subgraph. The `base` subgraph ID is the `Deployment ID` of your original `graph-example` subgraph. You can find this in Subgraph Studio.
3. Follow the directions in the `AUTH & DEPLOY` section on your subgraph page in the `graft-replacement` folder from the repo
4. 完成后，验证子图是否正确索引。如果在Graph Playground中运行下列指令。

```graphql
{
  withdrawals(first: 5) {
    id
    amount
    when
  }
}
```

它返回的结果是这样的:

```
{
  "data": {
    "withdrawals": [
      {
        "id": "0xe8323d21c4f104607b10b0fff9fc24b9612b9488795dea8196b2d5f980d3dc1d0a000000",
        "amount": "0",
        "when": "1716394824"
      },
      {
        "id": "0xea1cee35036f2cacb72f2a336be3e54ab911f5bebd58f23400ebb8ecc5cfc45203000000",
        "amount": "0",
        "when": "1716394848"
      },
      {
        "id": "0x2410475f76a44754bae66d293d14eac34f98ec03a3689cbbb56a716d20b209af06000000",
        "amount": "0",
        "when": "1716429732"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can see that the `graft-replacement` subgraph is indexing from older `graph-example` data and newer data from the new contract address. The original contract emitted two `Withdrawal` events, [Event 1](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xe8323d21c4f104607b10b0fff9fc24b9612b9488795dea8196b2d5f980d3dc1d) and [Event 2](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xea1cee35036f2cacb72f2a336be3e54ab911f5bebd58f23400ebb8ecc5cfc452). The new contract emitted one `Withdrawal` after, [Event 3](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x2410475f76a44754bae66d293d14eac34f98ec03a3689cbbb56a716d20b209af). The two previously indexed transactions (Event 1 and 2) and the new transaction (Event 3) were combined together in the `graft-replacement` subgraph.

Congrats! You have successfully grafted a subgraph onto another subgraph.
