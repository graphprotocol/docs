title: Deprecating a Subgraph
---

如果您想在 Graph浏览器上弃用您的子图，您来对地方了！ 请按照以下步骤操作：

1. 在[这里](https://etherscan.io/address/0xadca0dd4729c8ba3acf3e99f3a9f471ef37b6825#writeProxyContract)访问合约地址
2. Call `deprecateSubgraph` with your `SubgraphID` as your argument.
3. Voilà! Your subgraph will no longer show up on searches on The Graph Explorer.

Please note the following:

- The `deprecateSubgraph` function should be called by the owner's wallet.
- Curators will not be able to signal on the subgraph anymore.
- Curators that already signaled on the subgraph will be able to withdraw their signal at an average share price.
- Deprecated subgraphs will be indicated with an error message.

如果您与现已弃用的子图进行交互，您将能够分别在“子图”、“索引”或“策展”选项卡下的您的用户资料中找到它。
