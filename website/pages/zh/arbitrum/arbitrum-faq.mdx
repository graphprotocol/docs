## 为什么Graph实施L2解决方案？

通过缩放L2上的Graph，网络参与者可以预期：

-   Upwards of 26x savings on gas fees

-   更快的交易处理速度

-   Security inherited from Ethereum

Scaling the protocol smart contracts onto L2 allows network participants to interact more frequently at a reduced cost in gas fees. For example, Indexers could open and close allocations to index a greater number of subgraphs with greater frequency, developers could deploy and upgrade subgraphs with greater ease, Delegators could delegate GRT with increased frequency, and Curators could add or remove signal to a larger number of subgraphs–actions previously considered too cost-prohibitive to perform frequently due to gas.

The Graph community decided to move forward with Arbitrum last year after the outcome of the [GIP-0031](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0031-arbitrum-grt-bridge/3305) discussion.

## 我需要做什么才能在L2上使用Graph？

用户使用以下方法之一桥接GRT和ETH：

-   [The Graph Bridge on Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
-   [TransferTo](https://transferto.xyz/swap)
-   [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/)
-   [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/#/send?token=ETH)

要使用L2上的Graph，请使用此下拉开关在链之间切换。

## 作为子图开发人员、数据消费者、索引人、策展人或授权者，我现在需要做什么？

There is no immediate action required, however, network participants are encouraged to begin moving to Arbitrum to take advantage of the benefits of L2.

Core developer teams are working to create L2 transfer tools that will make it significantly easier to move delegation, curation, and subgraphs to Arbitrum. Network participants can expect L2 transfer tools to be available by summer of 2023.

截至2023年4月10日，所有索引奖励的5%都在Arbitrum上铸造。随着网络参与度的增加，以及理事会的批准，索引奖励将逐渐从以太坊转移到Arbitrum，最终完全转移到Arbitrum。

## 如果我想参加L2上的Graph网络，该怎么办？

Please help [test the network](https://testnet.thegraph.com/explorer) on L2 and report feedback about your experience in [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP).

## 将网络扩展到L2是否存在任何风险？

All smart contracts have been thoroughly [audited](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/dev/audits/OpenZeppelin/2022-07-graph-arbitrum-bridge-audit.pdf).

Everything has been tested thoroughly, and a contingency plan is in place to ensure a safe and seamless transition. Details can be found [here](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0037-the-graph-arbitrum-deployment-with-linear-rewards-minted-in-l2/3551#risks-and-security-considerations-20).

## 以太坊上现有的子图会继续工作吗？

是的，Graph网络合约将在以太坊和Arbitrum上并行运行，直到稍后完全迁移到Arbitrum。

## GRT会在Arbitrum上部署新的智能合约吗？

Yes, GRT has an additional [smart contract on Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9623063377ad1b27544c965ccd7342f7ea7e88c7). However, the Ethereum mainnet [GRT contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7) will remain operational.

## Arbitrum账单常见问题解答

## 我需要如何处理账单余额中的GRT？

什么都不用做！您的GRT已安全迁移到Arbitrum，并用于支付您阅读本文时的查询费用。

## 如何知道我的资金已安全转移到Arbitrum？

All GRT billing balances have already been successfully migrated to Arbitrum. You can view the billing contract on Arbitrum [here](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1B07D3344188908Fb6DEcEac381f3eE63C48477a).

## 怎么知道Arbitrum 跨链桥是安全的？

The bridge has been [heavily audited](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-the-graph-l2-bridge-contest) to ensure safety and security for all users.

## 如果从以太坊主网钱包添加新的GRT，需要做什么？

Adding GRT to your Arbitrum billing balance can be done with a one-click experience in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/). You'll be able to easily bridge your GRT to Arbitrum and fill your API keys in one transaction.

Visit the [Billing page](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/billing/) for more detailed instructions on adding, withdrawing, or acquiring GRT.
