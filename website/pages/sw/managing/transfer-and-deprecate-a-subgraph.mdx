title: Transfer and Deprecate a Subgraph
---

## Transferring ownership of a subgraph

Subgraphs published to the decentralized network have an NFT minted to the address that published the subgraph. The NFT is based on a standard ERC721, which facilitates transfers between accounts on The Graph Network.

**Please note the following:**

- Whoever owns the NFT controls the subgraph.
- If the owner decides to sell or transfer the NFT, they will no longer be able to edit or update that subgraph on the network.
- You can easily move control of a subgraph to a multi-sig.
- A community member can create a subgraph on behalf of a DAO.

### View your subgraph as an NFT

To view your subgraph as an NFT, you can visit an NFT marketplace like **OpenSea**:

```
https://opensea.io/your-wallet-address
```

Or a wallet explorer like **Rainbow.me**:

```
https://rainbow.me/your-wallet-addres
```

### Step-by-Step

To transfer ownership of a subgraph, do the following:

1. Use the UI built into Subgraph Studio:

2. Choose the address that you would like to transfer the subgraph to:

Optionally, you can also use the built-in UI of NFT marketplaces like OpenSea:

## Deprecating a subgraph

Although you cannot delete a subgraph, you can deprecate it on Graph Explorer.

### Step-by-Step

To deprecate your subgraph, do the following:

1. Visit the contract address for Arbitrum One subgraphs [here](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xec9A7fb6CbC2E41926127929c2dcE6e9c5D33Bec#writeProxyContract).
2. Call `deprecateSubgraph` with your `SubgraphID` as your argument.
3. Your subgraph will no longer appear in searches on Graph Explorer.

**Please note the following:**

- The owner's wallet should call the `deprecateSubgraph` function.
- Curators will not be able to signal on the subgraph anymore.
- Curators that already signaled on the subgraph can withdraw their signal at an average share price.
- Deprecated subgraphs will show an error message.

> If you interacted with the deprecated subgraph, you can find it in your user profile under the "Subgraphs", "Indexing", or "Curating" tab, respectively.
