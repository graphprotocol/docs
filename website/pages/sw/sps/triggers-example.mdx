title: "Tutorial: Set Up a Substreams-Powered Subgraph on Solana"
---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure to:

- Complete the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-starter) to set up your development environment using a Dev Container.
- Be familiar with The Graph and basic blockchain concepts such as transactions and Protobufs.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

<VideoEmbed youtube="satdwdbvzAQ" />

1. Open your Dev Container and run the following command to initialize your project:

   ```bash
   substreams init
   ```

2. Select the "minimal" project option.

3. Replace the contents of the generated `substreams.yaml` file with the following configuration, which filters transactions for the Orca account on the SPL token program ID:

```yaml
specVersion: v0.1.0
package:
  name: my_project_sol
  version: v0.1.0

imports: # Pass your spkg of interest
  solana: https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-solana-spl-token/raw/master/tokens/solana-spl-token-v0.1.0.spkg

modules:
  - name: map_spl_transfers
    use: solana:map_block # Select corresponding modules available within your spkg
    initialBlock: 260000082

  - name: map_transactions_by_programid
    use: solana:solana:transactions_by_programid_without_votes

network: solana-mainnet-beta

params: # Modify the param fields to meet your needs
  # For program_id: TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA
  map_spl_transfers: token_contract:orcaEKTdK7LKz57vaAYr9QeNsVEPfiu6QeMU1kektZE
```

## Step 2: Generate the Subgraph Manifest

Once the project is initialized, generate a subgraph manifest by running the following command in the Dev Container:

```bash
substreams codegen subgraph
```

You will generate a`subgraph.yaml` manifest which imports the Substreams package as a data source:

```yaml
---
dataSources:
  - kind: substreams
    name: my_project_sol
    network: solana-mainnet-beta
    source:
      package:
        moduleName: map_spl_transfers # Module defined in the substreams.yaml
        file: ./my-project-sol-v0.1.0.spkg
    mapping:
      apiVersion: 0.0.7
      kind: substreams/graph-entities
      file: ./src/mappings.ts
      handler: handleTriggers
```

## Step 3: Define Entities in `schema.graphql`

Define the fields you want to save in your subgraph entities by updating the `schema.graphql` file. Here is an example:

```graphql
type MyTransfer @entity {
  id: ID!
  amount: String!
  source: String!
  designation: String!
  signers: [String!]!
}
```

This schema defines a `MyTransfer` entity with fields such as `id`, `amount`, `source`, `designation`, and `signers`.

## Step 4: Handle Substreams Data in `mappings.ts`

With the Protobuf objects generated, you can now handle the decoded Substreams data in your `mappings.ts` file found in the `./src` directory. The example below demonstrates how to extract to subgraph entities the non-derived transfers associated to the Orca account id:

```ts
import { Protobuf } from 'as-proto/assembly'
import { Events as protoEvents } from './pb/sf/solana/spl/token/v1/Events'
import { MyTransfer } from '../generated/schema'

export function handleTriggers(bytes: Uint8Array): void {
  const input: protoEvents = Protobuf.decode<protoEvents>(bytes, protoEvents.decode)

  for (let i = 0; i < input.data.length; i++) {
    const event = input.data[i]

    if (event.transfer != null) {
      let entity_id: string = `${event.txnId}-${i}`
      const entity = new MyTransfer(entity_id)
      entity.amount = event.transfer!.instruction!.amount.toString()
      entity.source = event.transfer!.accounts!.source
      entity.designation = event.transfer!.accounts!.destination

      if (event.transfer!.accounts!.signer!.single != null) {
        entity.signers = [event.transfer!.accounts!.signer!.single!.signer]
      } else if (event.transfer!.accounts!.signer!.multisig != null) {
        entity.signers = event.transfer!.accounts!.signer!.multisig!.signers
      }
      entity.save()
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Generate Protobuf Files

To generate Protobuf objects in AssemblyScript, run the following command:

```bash
npm run protogen
```

This command converts the Protobuf definitions into AssemblyScript, allowing you to use them in the subgraph's handler.

## Conclusion

Youâ€™ve successfully set up a trigger-based Substreams-powered subgraph for a Solana SPL token. You can now further customize your schema, mappings, and modules to suit your specific use case.
