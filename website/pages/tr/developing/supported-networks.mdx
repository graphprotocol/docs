\* Preliminary network support via the [upgrade Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/upgrade-indexer/)  
&#8288;<sup>†</sup> Supports Substreams

The hosted service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints.

Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier. `xdai` is still supported for existing hosted service subgraphs.

Substreams-powered subgraphs indexing `mainnet` Ethereum are supported in Subgraph Studio and on the decentralized network.

## Graph Node

If your preferred network isn't supported on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph Node can also index other protocols, via a Firehose integration. Firehose integrations have been created for NEAR, Arweave and Cosmos-based networks.
