The hosted service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints.

Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are being deprecated. Read more on the [Ethereum Foundation Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/06/21/testnet-deprecation). As of Feb 25th 2023, Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are no longer supported by the hosted service. Goerli will be maintained by client developers post-merge, and is also supported by the hosted service. Developers who currently use Ropsten, Rinkeby or Kovan as their staging/testing environment are encouraged to migrate to Goerli.

## Graph Node

If your preferred network isn't supported on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph node'u, bir Firehose entegrasyonu yoluyla diğer protokolleri de indeksleyebilir. NEAR, Arweave ve Cosmos tabanlı ağlar için Firehose entegrasyonları oluşturulmuştur.
