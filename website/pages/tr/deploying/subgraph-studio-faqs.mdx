## 1. Subgraph Stüdyo Nedir?

[Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) is a dapp for creating, managing, and publishing subgraphs and API keys.

## 2. API Anahtarını Nasıl Oluşturabilirim?

To create an API, navigate to Subgraph Studio and connect your wallet. You will be able to click the API keys tab at the top. There, you will be able to create an API key.

## 3. Birden Çok API Anahtarı Oluşturabilir miyim?

Yes! You can create multiple API Keys to use in different projects. Check out the link [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).

## 4. API Anahtarı için Domain'i Nasıl Kısıtlarım?

After creating an API Key, in the Security section, you can define the domains that can query a specific API Key.

## 5. Subgraph'ımı Başka Birine Devredebilir miyim?

Yes, subgraphs that have been published to Arbitrum One can be transferred to a new wallet or a Multisig. You can do so by clicking the three dots next to the 'Publish' button on the subgraph's details page and selecting 'Transfer ownership'.

Note that you will no longer be able to see or edit the subgraph in Studio once it has been transferred.

## 6. Kullanmak İstediğim Subgraph'ın Geliştiricisi Değilsem, bu Subgraphlar için Sorgu URL'lerini Nasıl Bulabilirim?

You can find the query URL of each subgraph in the Subgraph Details section of Graph Explorer. When you click on the “Query” button, you will be directed to a pane wherein you can view the query URL of the subgraph you’re interested in. You can then replace the `<api_key>` placeholder with the API key you wish to leverage in Subgraph Studio.

Remember that you can create an API key and query any subgraph published to the network, even if you build a subgraph yourself. These queries via the new API key, are paid queries as any other on the network.
