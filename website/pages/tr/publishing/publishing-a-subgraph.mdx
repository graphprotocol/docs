title: Publishing a Subgraph to the Decentralized Network
---

Once your subgraph has been [deployed to the Subgraph Studio](/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio), you have tested it out, and are ready to put it into production, you can then publish it to the decentralized network.

Publishing a Subgraph to the decentralized network makes it available for [Curators](/network/curating) to begin curating on it, and [Indexers](/network/indexing) to begin indexing it.

For a walkthrough of how to publish a subgraph to the decentralized network, see [this video](https://youtu.be/HfDgC2oNnwo?t=580).

## Publishing a subgraph

Subgraphs can be published to the decentralized network directly from the Subgraph Studio dashboard by clicking on the **Publish** button. Once a subgraph is published, it will be available to view in the [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/).

- Subgraphs can be published to Goerli, Arbitrum goerli, Arbitrum One, or Ethereum mainnet.

- Regardless of the network the subgraph was published on, it can index data on any of the [supported networks](/developing/supported-networks).

- When publishing a new version for an existing subgraph the same rules apply as above.

## Curating your subgraph

> It is recommended that you curate your own subgraph with 10,000 GRT to ensure that it is indexed and available for querying as soon as possible.

Subgraph Studio enables you to be the first to curate your subgraph by adding GRT to your subgraph's curation pool in the same transaction. When publishing your subgraph, make sure to check the button that says, "Be the first to signal on this subgraph."

## Updating metadata for a published subgraph

Once your subgraph has been published to the decentralized network, you can modify the metadata at any time by making the update in the Subgraph Studio dashboard of the subgraph. After saving the changes and publishing your updates to the network, they will be reflected in The Graph Explorer. This won’t create a new version, as your deployment hasn’t changed.
