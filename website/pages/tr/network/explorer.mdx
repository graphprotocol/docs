Graph Gezgini'ne ya da bizim deyimimizle subgraphlar ve ağ verileri dünyasına açılan merkeziyetsiz portalınıza hoş geldiniz. 👩🏽‍🚀 Graph Gezgini, diğer subgraph geliştiricileri, merkeziyetsiz uygulama geliştiricileri, Küratörler, İndeksleyiciler ve Delegatörlerle etkileşime girebileceğiniz birden fazla bölümden oluşur. Graph Gezgini'ne genel bir bakış için aşağıdaki videoya göz atın (veya aşağıdan okumaya devam edin):

## Subgraph'ler

Her şeyden önce, Subgraph Stüdyo'da subgraph'ınızı dağıtmayı ve yayınlamayı yeni tamamladıysanız, gezinme çubuğunun üst kısmındaki Subgraphlar sekmesi, merkeziyetsiz ağda kendinizin tamamlanmış subgraphlar'ını (ve başkalarının subgraphlar'ını) görüntüleyebileceğiniz yerdir. Burada, oluşturulma tarihine, sinyal miktarına veya adına göre tam olarak aradığınız subgraph'ı bulabileceksiniz.

![Explorer Image 1](/img/Subgraphs-Explorer-Landing.png)

Bir subgraph tıkladığınızda, test alanında sorguları test edebilecek ve bilinçli kararlar vermek için ağ ayrıntılarından yararlanabileceksiniz. Ayrıca, kendi subgraph'ınız veya başkalarının subgraphlar'ında GRT sinyali vererek indeksleyicilerin bunun önemi ve kalitesinden haberdar olmasını sağlayabileceksiniz. Bu oldukça önemlidir, çünkü bir subgraph'ta sinyal vermek, pnun indekslenmesini teşvik eder, bu da onların nihayetinde sorguları sunmak için ağda görünmeleri anlamına gelir.

![Explorer Image 2](/img/Subgraph-Details.png)

Her bir subgraph'ın özel sayfasında, çeşitli ayrıntılar ortaya çıkmaktadır. Bunlar şunları içerir:

- Subgraphlar üzerinde sinyal/sinyalsizlik
- Grafikler, mevcut dağıtım kimliği ve diğer üst veri gibi daha fazla ayrıntı görüntüleme
- Subgraph'ın geçmiş yinelemelerini keşfetmek için sürümleri değiştirme
- GraphQL aracılığıyla subgraphlar'ı sorgulama
- Test alanında(playground) subgraphlar'ı test etme
- Belirli bir subgraph üzerinde indeksleme yapan İndeksleyicileri görüntüleme
- Subgraph istatistikleri (tahsisler, Küratörler, vb.)
- Subgraph'ı yayınlayan varlığı görüntüleme

## Katılımcılar

Bu kısımda İndeksleyiciler, Delegatörler ve Küratörler gibi ağ faaliyetlerine katılan tüm kişilerin kuş bakışı bir görüş elde edeceksiniz. Aşağıda, her bir kısmın sizin için ne anlama geldiğini derinlemesine inceleyeceğiz.

### 1. İndeksleyiciler

![Explorer Image 4](/img/Indexer-Pane.png)

İndeksleyiciler ile başlayalım. İndeksleyiciler protokolün bel kemiğidir, subgraphlar'a stake eden, indeksleyen ve subgraphlar'ı kullanan herkese sorgu sunan kişilerdir. İndeksleyiciler tablosunda, bir İndeksleyicinin temsilci parametrelerini, hisselerini, her bir subgraph'a ne kadar stake ettiklerini, sorgu ücretlerini ve indeksleme ödüllerinden ne kadar gelir elde ettiklerini görebileceksiniz. Derinlemesine incelemeler aşağıda:

- Sorgu Ücreti Kesintisi - İndeksleyici'nin Delegatörlerle bölüşürken tuttuğu sorgu ücreti indirimlerinin %'si
- Efektif Ödül Kesintisi - delegasyon havuzuna uygulanan indeksleme ödülü kesintisi. Eğer negatifse, indeksleyicinin ödüllerinin bir kısmını verdiği anlamına gelir. Pozitifse, İndeksleyicinin ödüllerinin bir kısmını elinde tuttuğu anlamına gelir
- Kalan Bekleme Süresi - İndeksleyici'nin yukarıdaki delegatör parametrelerini değiştirebilmesi için kalan süre. Bekleme süreleri, İndeksleyiciler tarafından delegatör parametrelerini güncellediklerinde ayarlanır
- Depozito - Bu, İndeksleyici'nin kötü niyetli veya yanlış davranışı sonucunda kesilebilecek yatırılmış payıdır
- Delege edilmiş - İndeksleyici tarafından tahsis edilebilen ancak kesilemeyen Delegatörler'in payları
- Tahsis edilmiş - İndeksleyiciler'in indeksledikleri subgraphlar'a aktif olarak ayırdıkları paydır
- Mevcut Delegasyon Kapasitesi - İndekslendiricilerin aşırı delege edilmiş duruma gelmeden önce alabilecekleri delege edilebilecek pay miktarı
- Maksimum Delegasyon Kapasitesi - Endekserin verimli bir şekilde kabul edebileceği en yüksek delegasyon miktarıdır. Fazla delege edilmiş pay, tahsisler veya ödül hesaplamaları için kullanılamaz.
- Sorgu Ücretleri - bu, son kullanıcıların bir İndeksleyiciden gelen sorgular için tüm zaman içinde ödediği toplam ücretlerdir
- İndeksleyici Ödülleri - bu, İndeksleyici ve Delegatörler tarafından tüm zaman boyunca kazanılan toplam indeksleyici ödülleridir. İndeksleyici ödülleri GRT ihracı yoluyla ödenir.

İndeksleyiciler hem sorgu ücretleri hem de indeksleme ödülleri kazanabilir. İşlevsel olarak bu, ağ katılımcıları GRT'yi bir İndeksleyiciye delege ettiğinde gerçekleşir. Bu, İndeksleyicilerin İndeksleyici parametrelerine bağlı olarak sorgu ücretleri ve ödüller almasına olanak sağlar. İndeksleme parametreleri, tablonun sağ tarafına tıklanarak veya bir İndeksleyicinin profiline girip "Delegate" düğmesine tıklanarak ayarlanır.

### 2. Curators

Curators analyze subgraphs to identify which subgraphs are of the highest quality. Once a Curator has found a potentially attractive subgraph, they can curate it by signaling on its bonding curve. In doing so, Curators let Indexers know which subgraphs are high quality and should be indexed.

Curators can be community members, data consumers, or even subgraph developers who signal on their own subgraphs by depositing GRT tokens into a bonding curve. By depositing GRT, Curators mint curation shares of a subgraph. As a result, Curators are eligible to earn a portion of the query fees that the subgraph they have signaled on generates. The bonding curve incentivizes Curators to curate the highest quality data sources. The Curator table in this section will allow you to see:

- The date the Curator started curating
- The number of GRT that was deposited
- The number of shares a Curator owns

If you want to learn more about the Curator role, you can do so by visiting the following links of [The Graph Academy](https://thegraph.academy/curators/) or [official documentation.](/network/curating)

### 3. Delegators

Delegators play a key role in maintaining the security and decentralization of The Graph Network. They participate in the network by delegating (i.e., “staking”) GRT tokens to one or multiple indexers. Without Delegators, Indexers are less likely to earn significant rewards and fees. Therefore, Indexers seek to attract Delegators by offering them a portion of the indexing rewards and query fees that they earn.

Delegators, in turn, select Indexers based on a number of different variables, such as past performance, indexing reward rates, and query fee cuts. Reputation within the community can also play a factor in this! It’s recommended to connect with the indexers selected via [The Graph’s Discord](https://thegraph.com/discord) or [The Graph Forum](https://forum.thegraph.com/)!

![Explorer Image 7](/img/Delegation-Overview.png)

The Delegators table will allow you to see the active Delegators in the community, as well as metrics such as:

- The number of Indexers a Delegator is delegating towards
- A Delegator’s original delegation
- The rewards they have accumulated but have not withdrawn from the protocol
- The realized rewards they withdrew from the protocol
- Total amount of GRT they have currently in the protocol
- The date they last delegated at

If you want to learn more about how to become a Delegator, look no further! All you have to do is to head over to the [official documentation](/network/delegating) or [The Graph Academy](https://docs.thegraph.academy/official-docs/delegator/choosing-indexers).

## Network

In the Network section, you will see global KPIs as well as the ability to switch to a per-epoch basis and analyze network metrics in more detail. These details will give you a sense of how the network is performing over time.

### Activity

The activity section has all the current network metrics as well as some cumulative metrics over time. Here you can see things like:

- The current total network stake
- The stake split between the Indexers and their Delegators
- Total supply, minted, and burned GRT since the network inception
- Total Indexing rewards since the inception of the protocol
- Protocol parameters such as curation reward, inflation rate, and more
- Current epoch rewards and fees

A few key details that are worth mentioning:

- **Query fees represent the fees generated by the consumers**, and they can be claimed (or not) by the Indexers after a period of at least 7 epochs (see below) after their allocations towards the subgraphs have been closed and the data they served has been validated by the consumers.
- **Indexing rewards represent the amount of rewards the Indexers claimed from the network issuance during the epoch.** Although the protocol issuance is fixed, the rewards only get minted once the Indexers close their allocations towards the subgraphs they’ve been indexing. Thus the per-epoch number of rewards varies (ie. during some epochs, Indexers might’ve collectively closed allocations that have been open for many days).

![Explorer Image 8](/img/Network-Stats.png)

### Epochs

In the Epochs section, you can analyze on a per-epoch basis, metrics such as:

- Epoch start or end block
- Query fees generated and indexing rewards collected during a specific epoch
- Epoch status, which refers to the query fee collection and distribution and can have different states:
  - The active epoch is the one in which Indexers are currently allocating stake and collecting query fees
  - The settling epochs are the ones in which the state channels are being settled. This means that the Indexers are subject to slashing if the consumers open disputes against them.
  - The distributing epochs are the epochs in which the state channels for the epochs are being settled and Indexers can claim their query fee rebates.
  - The finalized epochs are the epochs that have no query fee rebates left to claim by the Indexers, thus being finalized.

## Your User Profile

Now that we’ve talked about the network stats, let’s move on to your personal profile. Your personal profile is the place for you to see your network activity, no matter how you’re participating on the network. Your crypto wallet will act as your user profile, and with the User Dashboard, you’ll be able to see:

### Profile Overview

This is where you can see any current actions you took. This is also where you can find your profile information, description, and website (if you added one).

![Explorer Image 10](/img/Profile-Overview.png)

### Subgraphs Tab

If you click into the Subgraphs tab, you’ll see your published subgraphs. This will not include any subgraphs deployed with the CLI for testing purposes – subgraphs will only show up when they are published to the decentralized network.

![Explorer Image 11](/img/Subgraphs-Overview.png)

### Indexing Tab

If you click into the Indexing tab, you’ll find a table with all the active and historical allocations towards the subgraphs, as well as charts that you can analyze and see your past performance as an Indexer.

This section will also include details about your net Indexer rewards and net query fees. You’ll see the following metrics:

- Delegated Stake - the stake from Delegators that can be allocated by you but cannot be slashed
- Total Query Fees - the total fees that users have paid for queries served by you over time
- Indexer Rewards - the total amount of Indexer rewards you have received, in GRT
- Fee Cut - the % of query fee rebates that you will keep when you split with Delegators
- Rewards Cut - the % of Indexer rewards that you will keep when splitting with Delegators
- Owned - your deposited stake, which could be slashed for malicious or incorrect behavior

![Explorer Image 12](/img/Indexer-Stats.png)

### Delegating Tab

Delegators are important to the Graph Network. A Delegator must use their knowledge to choose an Indexer that will provide a healthy return on rewards. Here you can find details of your active and historical delegations, along with the metrics of the Indexers that you delegated towards.

In the first half of the page, you can see your delegation chart, as well as the rewards-only chart. To the left, you can see the KPIs that reflect your current delegation metrics.

The Delegator metrics you’ll see here in this tab include:

- Total delegation rewards
- Total unrealized rewards
- Total realized rewards

In the second half of the page, you have the delegations table. Here you can see the Indexers that you delegated towards, as well as their details (such as rewards cuts, cooldown, etc).

With the buttons on the right side of the table, you can manage your delegation - delegate more, undelegate, or withdraw your delegation after the thawing period.

Keep in mind that this chart is horizontally scrollable, so if you scroll all the way to the right, you can also see the status of your delegation (delegating, undelegating, withdrawable).

![Explorer Image 13](/img/Delegation-Stats.png)

### Curating Tab

In the Curation tab, you’ll find all the subgraphs you’re signaling on (thus enabling you to receive query fees). Signaling allows Curators to highlight to Indexers which subgraphs are valuable and trustworthy, thus signaling that they need to be indexed on.

Within this tab, you’ll find an overview of:

- All the subgraphs you're curating on with signal details
- Share totals per subgraph
- Query rewards per subgraph
- Updated at date details

![Explorer Image 14](/img/Curation-Stats.png)

## Your Profile Settings

Within your user profile, you’ll be able to manage your personal profile details (like setting up an ENS name). If you’re an Indexer, you have even more access to settings at your fingertips. In your user profile, you’ll be able to set up your delegation parameters and operators.

- Operators take limited actions in the protocol on the Indexer's behalf, such as opening and closing allocations. Operators are typically other Ethereum addresses, separate from their staking wallet, with gated access to the network that Indexers can personally set
- Delegation parameters allow you to control the distribution of GRT between you and your Delegators.

![Explorer Image 15](/img/Profile-Settings.png)

As your official portal into the world of decentralized data, The Graph Explorer allows you to take a variety of actions, no matter your role in the network. You can get to your profile settings by opening the dropdown menu next to your address, then clicking on the Settings button.
