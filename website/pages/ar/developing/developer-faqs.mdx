## 1. What is a subgraph?

A subgraph is a custom API built on blockchain data. Subgraphs are queried using the GraphQL query language and are deployed to a Graph Node using the Graph CLI. Once deployed and published to The Graph's decentralized network, Indexers process subgraphs and make them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

## 2. Can I delete my subgraph?

لا يمكن حذف ال Subgraph بمجرد إنشائها.

## 3. Can I change my subgraph name?

لا. بمجرد إنشاء ال Subgraph ، لا يمكن تغيير الاسم. تأكد من التفكير بعناية قبل إنشاء ال Subgraph الخاص بك حتى يسهل البحث عنه والتعرف عليه من خلال ال Dapps الأخرى.

## 4. Can I change the GitHub account associated with my subgraph?

لا. بمجرد إنشاء ال Subgraph ، لا يمكن تغيير حساب GitHub المرتبط. تأكد من التفكير بعناية قبل إنشاء ال Subgraph الخاص بك.

## 5. Am I still able to create a subgraph if my smart contracts don't have events?

It is highly recommended that you structure your smart contracts to have events associated with data you are interested in querying. Event handlers in the subgraph are triggered by contract events and are by far the fastest way to retrieve useful data.

If the contracts you are working with do not contain events, your subgraph can use call and block handlers to trigger indexing. Although this is not recommended, as performance will be significantly slower.

## 6. Is it possible to deploy one subgraph with the same name for multiple networks?

You will need separate names for multiple networks. While you can't have different subgraphs under the same name, there are convenient ways of having a single codebase for multiple networks. Find more on this in our documentation: [Redeploying a Subgraph](/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-hosted#redeploying-a-subgraph)

## 7. How are templates different from data sources?

Templates allow you to create data sources on the fly, while your subgraph is indexing. It might be the case that your contract will spawn new contracts as people interact with it, and since you know the shape of those contracts (ABI, events, etc) upfront you can define how you want to index them in a template and when they are spawned your subgraph will create a dynamic data source by supplying the contract address.

Check out the "Instantiating a data source template" section on: [Data Source Templates](/developing/creating-a-subgraph#data-source-templates).

## 8. How do I make sure I'm using the latest version of graph-node for my local deployments?

يمكنك تشغيل الأمر التالي:

```sh
docker pull graphprotocol/graph-node:latest
```

**ملاحظة:** سيستخدم docker / docker-compose دائما أي إصدار من graph-node تم سحبه في المرة الأولى التي قمت بتشغيلها ، لذلك من المهم القيام بذلك للتأكد من أنك محدث بأحدث إصدار من graph-node.

## 9. How do I call a contract function or access a public state variable from my subgraph mappings?

Take a look at `Access to smart contract` state inside the section [AssemblyScript API](/developing/assemblyscript-api).

## 10. Is it possible to set up a subgraph using `graph init` from `graph-cli` with two contracts? Or should I manually add another datasource in `subgraph.yaml` after running `graph init`?

Unfortunately, this is currently not possible. `graph init` is intended as a basic starting point, from which you can then add more data sources manually.

## 11. I want to contribute or add a GitHub issue. Where can I find the open source repositories?

- [graph-node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node)
- [graph-cli](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli)
- [graph-ts](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts)

## 12. What is the recommended way to build "autogenerated" ids for an entity when handling events?

إذا تم إنشاء كيان واحد فقط أثناء الحدث ولم يكن هناك أي شيء متاح بشكل أفضل ، فسيكون hash الإجراء + فهرس السجل فريدا. يمكنك إبهامها عن طريق تحويلها إلى Bytes ثم تمريرها عبر `crypto.keccak256` ولكن هذا لن يجعلها فريدة من نوعها.

## 13. When listening to multiple contracts, is it possible to select the contract order to listen to events?

ضمن ال Subgraph ، تتم معالجة الأحداث دائمًا بالترتيب الذي تظهر به في الكتل ، بغض النظر عما إذا كان ذلك عبر عقود متعددة أم لا.

## 14. Is it possible to differentiate between networks (mainnet, Goerli, local) from within event handlers?

نعم. يمكنك القيام بذلك عن طريق استيراد `graph-ts` كما في المثال أدناه:

```javascript
'import { dataSource } from '@graphprotocol/graph-ts

()dataSource.network
()dataSource.address
```

## 15. Do you support block and call handlers on Goerli?

Yes. Goerli supports block handlers, call handlers and event handlers. It should be noted that event handlers are far more performant than the other two handlers, and they are supported on every EVM-compatible network.

## 16. Can I import ethers.js or other JS libraries into my subgraph mappings?

ليس حاليًا ، حيث تتم كتابة ال mappings في AssemblyScript. أحد الحلول البديلة الممكنة لذلك هو تخزين البيانات الأولية في الكيانات وتنفيذ المنطق الذي يتطلب مكتبات JS على ال client.

## 17. Is it possible to specify what block to start indexing on?

Yes. `dataSources.source.startBlock` in the `subgraph.yaml` file specifies the number of the block that the data source starts indexing from. In most cases, we suggest using the block in which the contract was created: Start blocks

## 18. Are there some tips to increase the performance of indexing? My subgraph is taking a very long time to sync

Yes, you should take a look at the optional start block feature to start indexing from the block that the contract was deployed: [Start blocks](/developing/creating-a-subgraph#start-blocks)

## 19. Is there a way to query the subgraph directly to determine the latest block number it has indexed?

نعم! جرب الأمر التالي ، مع استبدال "Organization / subgraphName" بالمؤسسة واسم الـ subgraph الخاص بك:

```sh
curl -X POST -d '{ "query": "{indexingStatusForCurrentVersion(subgraphName: \"organization/subgraphName\") { chains { latestBlock { hash number }}}}"}' https://api.thegraph.com/index-node/graphql
```

## 20. What networks are supported by The Graph?

You can find the list of the supported networks [here](/developing/supported-networks).

## 21. Is it possible to duplicate a subgraph to another account or endpoint without redeploying?

يجب عليك إعادة نشر ال الفرعيةرسم بياني ، ولكن إذا لم يتغير الفرعيةرسم بياني (ID (IPFS hash ، فلن يضطر إلى المزامنة من البداية.

## 22. Is this possible to use Apollo Federation on top of graph-node?

لم يتم دعم Federation بعد ، على الرغم من أننا نريد دعمه في المستقبل. و في الوقت الحالي ، الذي يمكنك القيام به هو استخدام schema stitching ، إما على client أو عبر خدمة البروكسي.

## 23. Is there a limit to how many objects The Graph can return per query?

By default, query responses are limited to 100 items per collection. If you want to receive more, you can go up to 1000 items per collection and beyond that, you can paginate with:

```graphql
someCollection(first: 1000, skip: <number>) { ... }
```

## 24. If my dapp frontend uses The Graph for querying, do I need to write my query key into the frontend directly? What if we pay query fees for users – will malicious users cause our query fees to be very high?

Currently, the recommended approach for a dapp is to add the key to the frontend and expose it to end users. That said, you can limit that key to a hostname, like _yourdapp.io_ and subgraph. The gateway is currently being run by Edge & Node. Part of the responsibility of a gateway is to monitor for abusive behavior and block traffic from malicious clients.

## 25. Where do I go to find my current subgraph on the Hosted Service?

Head over to the hosted service in order to find subgraphs that you or others deployed to the hosted service. You can find it [here](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service).

## 26. Will the Hosted Service start charging query fees?

The Graph will never charge for the hosted service. The Graph is a decentralized protocol, and charging for a centralized service is not aligned with The Graph’s values. The hosted service was always a temporary step to help get to the decentralized network. Developers will have a sufficient amount of time to upgrade to the decentralized network as they are comfortable.

## 27. When will the Hosted Service be shut down?

The hosted service will shut down in 2023. Read the announcement blog post [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/sunsetting-hosted-service). All dapps using the hosted service are encouraged to upgrade to the decentralized network. Network Grants are available for developers to help upgrade their subgraph to The Graph Network. If your dapp is upgrading a subgraph you can apply [here](https://thegraph.typeform.com/to/Zz8UAPri?typeform-source=thegraph.com).

## 28. How do I update a subgraph on mainnet?

If you’re a subgraph developer, you can deploy a new version of your subgraph to the Subgraph Studio using the CLI. It’ll be private at that point, but if you’re happy with it, you can publish to the decentralized Graph Explorer. This will create a new version of your subgraph that Curators can start signaling on.
