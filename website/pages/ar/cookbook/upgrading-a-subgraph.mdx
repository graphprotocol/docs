title: Upgrading an Existing Subgraph to The Graph Network
---

## مقدمة

This is a guide on how to upgrade your subgraph from the hosted service to The Graph's decentralized network. Over 1,000 subgraphs have successfully upgraded to The Graph Network including projects like Snapshot, Loopring, Audius, Premia, Livepeer, Uma, Curve, Lido, and many more!

The process of upgrading is quick and your subgraphs will forever benefit from the reliability and performance that you can only get on The Graph Network.

### المتطلبات الأساسية

- You have already deployed a subgraph on the hosted service.
- القراف الفرعي يقوم بفهرسة سلسلة متوفرة (أو متوفرة في النسخة التجريبية) على شبكة القراف.
- You have a wallet with ETH to publish your subgraph on-chain.
- You have ~10,000 GRT to curate your subgraph so Indexers can begin indexing it.

## Upgrading an Existing Subgraph to The Graph Network

> You can find specific commands for your subgraph in the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

1.  احصل على أحدث إصدار من graph-cli المثبت:

```sh
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

```sh
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

Make sure your `apiVersion` in subgraph.yaml is `0.0.5` or greater.

2.  Inside the subgraph's main project repository, authenticate the subgraph to deploy and build on the studio:

```sh
graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
```

3.  أنشئ الملفات وقم ببناء الـ الفرعيةرسمبياني:

```sh
graph codegen && graph build
```

If your subgraph has build errors, refer to the [AssemblyScript Migration Guide](/release-notes/assemblyscript-migration-guide/).

4.  Sign into [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) with your wallet and deploy the subgraph. You can find your `<SUBGRAPH_SLUG>` in the Studio UI, which is based on the name of your subgraph.

```sh
graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

5.  Test queries on the Studio's playground. Here are some examples for the [Sushi - Mainnet Exchange Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph?id=0x4bb4c1b0745ef7b4642feeccd0740dec417ca0a0-0&view=Playground):

```sh
{
  users(first: 5) {
    id
    liquidityPositions {
      id
    }
  }
  bundles(first: 5) {
    id
    ethPrice
  }
}
```

6.  At this point, your subgraph is now deployed on Subgraph Studio, but not yet published to the decentralized network. You can now test the subgraph to make sure it is working as intended using the temporary query URL as seen on top of the right column above. As this name already suggests, this is a temporary URL and should not be used in production.

- Updating is just publishing another version of your existing subgraph on-chain.
- Because this incurs a cost, it is highly recommended to deploy and test your subgraph in the Subgraph Studio, using the "Development Query URL" before publishing. See an example transaction [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0c3fa0bc035703c9ba1ce40c1862559b9c5b6ea1198b3320871d535aa0de87b). Prices are roughly around 0.0425 ETH at 100 gwei.
- Any time you need to update your subgraph, you will be charged an update fee. Because this incurs a cost, it is highly recommended to deploy and test your subgraph on Goerli before deploying to mainnet. It can, in some cases, also require some GRT if there is no signal on that subgraph. In the case there is signal/curation on that subgraph version (using auto-migrate), the taxes will be split.

7.  Publish the subgraph on The Graph's decentralized network by hitting the "Publish" button.

You should curate your subgraph with GRT to ensure that it is indexed by Indexers. To save on gas costs, you can curate your subgraph in the same transaction that you publish it to the network. It is recommended to curate your subgraph with at least 10,000 GRT for high quality of service.

And that's it! After you are done publishing, you'll be able to view your subgraphs live on the decentralized network via [The Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer).

Feel free to leverage the [#Curators channel](https://discord.gg/rC8rBuRtbH) on Discord to let Curators know that your subgraph is ready to be signaled. It would also be helpful if you share your expected query volume with them. Therefore, they can estimate how much GRT they should signal on your subgraph.

### Create an API key

You can generate an API key in Subgraph Studio [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).

![API key creation page](/img/api-image.png)

At the end of each week, an invoice will be generated based on the query fees that have been incurred during this period. This invoice will be paid automatically using the GRT available in your balance. Your balance will be updated after the cost of your query fees are withdrawn. Query fees are paid in GRT via the Arbitrum network. You will need to add GRT to the Arbitrum billing contract to enable your API key via the following steps:

- Purchase GRT on an exchange of your choice.
- Send the GRT to your wallet.
- On the Billing page in Studio, click on Add GRT.

![Add GRT in billing](/img/Add-GRT-New-Page.png)

- Follow the steps to add your GRT to your billing balance.
- Your GRT will be automatically bridged to the Arbitrum network and added to your billing balance.

![Billing pane](/img/New-Billing-Pane.png)

> Note: see the [official billing page](../billing.mdx) for full instructions on adding GRT to your billing balance.

### Securing your API key

It is recommended that you secure the API by limiting its usage in two ways:

1.  Authorized Subgraphs
2.  Authorized Domain

You can secure your API key [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/test/).

![Subgraph lockdown page](/img/subgraph-lockdown.png)

### Querying your subgraph on the decentralized network

Now you can check the indexing status of the Indexers on the network in Graph Explorer (example [here](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph?id=S9ihna8D733WTEShJ1KctSTCvY1VJ7gdVwhUujq4Ejo&view=Indexers)). The green line at the top indicates that at the time of posting 8 Indexers successfully indexed that subgraph. Also in the Indexer tab you can see which Indexers picked up your subgraph.

![Rocket Pool subgraph](/img/rocket-pool-subgraph.png)

As soon as the first Indexer has fully indexed your subgraph you can start to query the subgraph on the decentralized network. In order to retrieve the query URL for your subgraph, you can copy/paste it by clicking on the symbol next to the query URL. You will see something like this:

`https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/S9ihna8D733WTEShJ1KctSTCvY1VJ7gdVwhUujq4Ejo`

Important: Make sure to replace `[api-key]` with an actual API key generated in the section above.

You can now use that Query URL in your dapp to send your GraphQL requests to.

Congratulations! You are now a pioneer of decentralization!

> Note: Due to the distributed nature of the network it might be the case that different Indexers have indexed up to different blocks. In order to only receive fresh data you can specify the minimum block an Indexer has to have indexed in order to serve your query with the block: `{ number_gte: $minBlock }` field argument as shown in the example below:

```graphql
{
  stakers(block: { number_gte: 14486109 }) {
    id
  }
}
```

More information about the nature of the network and how to handle re-orgs are described in the documentation article [Distributed Systems](/querying/distributed-systems/).

## Updating a Subgraph on the Network

If you would like to update an existing subgraph on the network, you can do this by deploying a new version of your subgraph to the Subgraph Studio using the Graph CLI.

1.  Make changes to your current subgraph. A good idea is to test small fixes on the Subgraph Studio by publishing to Goerli.
2.  انشر ما يلي وحدد الإصدار الجديد في الأمر (مثل v0.0.1 ، v0.0.2 ، إلخ):

```sh
graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

3.  اختبر الإصدار الجديد في Subgraph Studio من خلال الاستعلام في الـ playground
4.  انشر الإصدار الجديد على شبكة The Graph. تذكر أن هذا يتطلب غاز (كما هو موضح في القسم أعلاه).

### Owner Update Fee: Deep Dive

> Note: Curation on Arbitrum does not use bonding curves. Learn more about Arbitrum [here](/arbitrum/arbitrum-faq/).

An update requires GRT to be migrated from the old version of the subgraph to the new version. This means that for every update, a new bonding curve will be created (more on bonding curves [here](/network/curating#bonding-curve-101)).

The new bonding curve charges the 1% curation tax on all GRT being migrated to the new version. The owner must pay 50% of this or 1.25%. The other 1.25% is absorbed by all the curators as a fee. This incentive design is in place to prevent an owner of a subgraph from being able to drain all their curator's funds with recursive update calls. If there is no curation activity, you will have to pay a minimum of 100 GRT in order to signal your own subgraph.

كمثال على ذلك ، هذه هي الحالة فقط إذا كان الـ subgraph الخاص بك يتم تنسيقه بشكل نشط:

- تتم الإشارة بـ 100،000 GRT باستخدام الترحيل التلقائي في v1 لـ subgraph
- Owner updates to v2. 100,000 GRT is migrated to a new bonding curve, where 97,500 GRT get put into the new curve and 2,500 GRT is burned
- The owner then has 1250 GRT burned to pay for half the fee. The owner must have this in their wallet before the update, otherwise, the update will not succeed. This happens in the same transaction as the update.

_While this mechanism is currently live on the network, the community is currently discussing ways to reduce the cost of updates for subgraph developers._

### الحفاظ على إصدار مستقر من Subgraph

If you're making a lot of changes to your subgraph, it is not a good idea to continually update it and front the update costs. Maintaining a stable and consistent version of your subgraph is critical, not only from the cost perspective but also so that Indexers can feel confident in their syncing times. Indexers should be flagged when you plan for an update so that Indexer syncing times do not get impacted. Feel free to leverage the [#Indexers channel](https://discord.gg/rC8rBuRtbH) on Discord to let Indexers know when you're versioning your subgraphs.

Subgraphs are open APIs that external developers are leveraging. Open APIs need to follow strict standards so that they do not break external developers' applications. In The Graph Network, a subgraph developer must consider Indexers and how long it takes them to sync a new subgraph **as well as** other developers who are using their subgraphs.

### تحديث البيانات الوصفية (Metadata) لـ Subgraph

يمكنك تحديث البيانات الوصفية لـ subgraphs الخاص بك دون الحاجة إلى نشر إصدار جديد. تتضمن البيانات الوصفية اسم الـ subgraph والصورة والوصف و URL لموقع الويب و URL كود المصدر والفئات. يمكن للمطورين القيام بذلك عن طريق تحديث تفاصيل الـ subgraph الخاصة بهم في Subgraph Studio حيث يمكنك تعديل جميع الحقول الملائمة.

Make sure **Update Subgraph Details in Explorer** is checked and click on **Save**. If this is checked, an on-chain transaction will be generated that updates subgraph details in the Explorer without having to publish a new version with a new deployment.

## أفضل الممارسات لنشر Subgraph على شبكة The Graph

1.  الاستفادة من اسم ENS لتطوير الـ Subgraph:

- Set up your ENS [here](https://app.ens.domains/)
- Add your ENS name to your settings [here](https://thegraph.com/explorer/settings?view=display-name).

2.  كلما تم ملء البروفايل الخاص بك ، كلما زادت فرص فهرسة الـ subgraphs الخاصة بك وتنسيقها.

## إيقاف Subgraph على شبكة The Graph

Follow the steps [here](/managing/deprecating-a-subgraph) to deprecate your subgraph and remove it from The Graph Network.

## الاستعلام عن Subgraph + الفوترة على شبكة The Graph

The hosted service was set up to allow developers to deploy their subgraphs without any restrictions.

In order for The Graph Network to truly be decentralized, query fees have to be paid as a core part of the protocol's incentives. For more information on subscribing to APIs and paying the query fees, check out billing documentation [here](/billing/).

### تقدير رسوم الاستعلام على الشبكة

على الرغم من أن هذه ليست ميزة موجودة في واجهة مستخدم المنتج ، إلا أنه يمكنك تعيين الحد الأقصى لميزانيتك لكل استعلام وذلك عن طريق أخذ المبلغ الذي ترغب في دفعه شهريًا وتقسيمه على حجم الاستعلام المتوقع.

While you get to decide on your query budget, there is no guarantee that an Indexer will be willing to serve queries at that price. If a Gateway can match you to an Indexer willing to serve a query at, or lower than, the price you are willing to pay, you will pay the delta/difference of your budget **and** their price. As a consequence, a lower query price reduces the pool of Indexers available to you, which may affect the quality of service you receive. It's beneficial to have high query fees, as that may attract curation and big-name Indexers to your subgraph.

Remember that it's a dynamic and growing market, but how you interact with it is in your control. There is no maximum or minimum price specified in the protocol or the Gateways. For example, you can look at the price paid by a few of the dapps on the network (on a per-week basis), below. See the last column, which shows query fees in GRT.
