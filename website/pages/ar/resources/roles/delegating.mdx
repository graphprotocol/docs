# Delegating GRT on The Graph Network

Delegators play a crucial role on The Graph Network by delegating GRT to Indexers. This process supports network security and functionality without requiring Delegators to run a Graph Node.

## Benefits of Delegating

- Strengthen the network’s security and scalability by supporting Indexers.  
- Earn a portion of rewards generated by the Indexers.

## How Does Delegation Work?

An Indexer's ability to process queries and earn rewards depends on three key factors:  

1. The Indexer's Self-Stake (GRT staked by the Indexer).  
2. The total GRT delegated to them by Delegators.  
3. The price the Indexer sets for queries.

The more GRT staked and delegated to an Indexer, the more queries they can serve, leading to higher potential rewards.

### What is Delegation Capacity?

Delegation Capacity refers to the maximum amount of GRT an Indexer can accept from Delegators, based on the Indexer's Self-Stake.

The Graph Network includes a delegation ratio of 16, meaning an Indexer can accept up to 16 times their Self-Stake in delegated tokens.

For example, if an Indexer has a Self-Stake of 1m GRT, their delegation capacity is 16m.

### Why Does Delegation Capacity Matter?

If an Indexer exceeds their Delegation Capacity, rewards for all Delegators become diluted because the excess delegated GRT cannot be used effectively within the protocol.

This makes it crucial for Delegators to evaluate an Indexer's current Delegation Capacity before selecting an Indexer.

Indexers can increase their Delegation Capacity by their Self-Stake, thereby raising the limit for delegated tokens.

## What Delegators Need to Know

Learn how to be an effective Delegator in The Graph Network.

Delegators share the earnings of the protocol alongside all Indexers based on their delegated stake. Therefore, they must use their best judgment to choose Indexers based on multiple factors.

## Delegation Risks

القائمة أدناه هي المخاطر الرئيسية لكونك مفوضا في البروتوكول.

### The Delegation Tax

Delegators cannot be slashed for bad behavior, but there is a tax on Delegators to disincentivize poor decision-making that could harm the integrity of the network.

As a Delegator, it's important to understand the following:

- You will be charged 0.5% every time you delegate. This means that if you delegate 1,000 GRT, you will automatically burn 5 GRT.

- In order to be safe, you should calculate your potential return when delegating to an Indexer. For example, you might calculate how many days it will take before you have earned back the 0.5% tax on your delegation.

### The Delegation Unbonding Period

Whene a Delegator chooses to undelegate, their tokens are subject to a 28-day unbonding period.

This means they cannot transfer their tokens or earn any rewards for 28 days.

After the unbonding period, GRT will return to your crypto wallet.

### Why is this important?

If you choose an Indexer that is not trustworthy or not doing a good job, you will want to undelegate. This means you will be losing a lot of opportunities to earn rewards, which can be just as bad as burning GRT. As a result, it’s recommended that you choose an Indexer wisely.

### اختيار مفهرس جدير بالثقة مع عائد جيد للمفوضين

In order to understand how to choose a trustworthy Indexer, you need to understand the Delegation Parameters.

#### Delegation Parameters

- **Indexing Reward Cut** - The portion of the rewards the Indexer will keep for themselves.
  - If an Indexer's reward cut is set to 100%, as a Delegator, you will get 0 indexing rewards.
  - If it is set to 80%, as a Delegator, you will receive 20%.

<div sx={{ mx: 'auto', maxWidth: '700px' }}>
  ![Indexing Reward Cut](/img/Indexing-Reward-Cut.png) *The top Indexer is giving Delegators 90% of the rewards. The
  middle one is giving Delegators 20%. The bottom one is giving Delegators ~83%.*
</div>

- **Query Fee Cut** - This is just like the Indexing Reward Cut, but it applies to returns on the query fees that the Indexer collects.

As you can see, in order to choose the right Indexer, you must consider multiple things.

- It is highly recommend that you explore [The Graph Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol) to determine which Indexers have the best social and technical reputations and which ones reward Delegators consistently.
- Many Indexers are very active in Discord and will be happy to answer your questions.
- Many of them have been Indexing for months, and they are doing their best to help Delegators earn a good return, as it improves the health and success of the network.

## Calculating Delegators Expected Return

A Delegator must consider the following factors to determine a return:

- Consider an Indexer's ability to use the Delegated tokens available to them.
  - If an Indexer is not allocating all the tokens available, they are not earning the maximum profit they could be for themselves or their Delegators.
- Pay attention to the first few days of delegating.
  - An Indexer can choose to close an allocation and collect rewards anytime between 1 and 28 days. It is possible that an Indexer might have a lot of rewards they still need to collect, so their total rewards are low.

### النظر في اقتطاع رسوم الاستعلام query fee cut واقتطاع رسوم الفهرسة indexing fee cut

You should choose an Indexer that is transparent and honest about setting their Query Fee and Indexing Fee Cuts. You should also look at the Parameters Cooldown time to see how much of a time buffer you have. After that is done, it is simple to calculate the amount of rewards you are getting.

The formula is:

### النظر في أسهم تفويض المفهرس

Delegators should consider the proportion of the Delegation Pool they own.

All delegation rewards are shared evenly, with a pool rebalancing based on the amount the Delegator deposited into the pool.

This gives the Delegator a share of the pool:

![Share formula](/img/Share-Forumla.png)

> The formula above shows that it is possible for an Indexer offering only 20% to Delegators to provide a better reward than an Indexer giving 90%. Simply do the math to determine the best reward.

### النظر في سعة التفويض (delegation capacity)

Finally, consider the delegation capacity. Currently, the Delegation Ratio is set to 16.

#### Why does this matter?

This means that if an Indexer has staked 1,000,000 GRT, their Delegation Capacity is 16,000,000 GRT of delegated tokens that they can use in the protocol. Any delegated tokens over this amount will dilute all the Delegator rewards.

Imagine an Indexer with 100,000,000 GRT delegated to them, but their capacity is only 16,000,000 GRT. This means effectively, 84,000,000 GRT tokens are not being used to earn tokens. So, both the Delegators and the Indexers are earning less rewards than they could be.

Therefore, a Delegator should always consider the Delegation Capacity of an Indexer, and factor it into their decision making.

## Delegator FAQs and Bugs

### MetaMask "Pending Transaction" Bug

1. When I try to delegate my transaction in MetaMask, it appears as "Pending" or "Queued" for longer than expected. What should I do?

At times, attempts to delegate to Indexers via MetaMask can fail and result in prolonged periods of "Pending" or "Queued" transaction attempts.

A simple resolution to this bug is to restart the browser (e.g., using "abort:restart" in the address bar), which will cancel all previous attempts without gas being subtracted from the wallet. Several users who have encountered this issue have reported successful transactions after restarting their browser and attempting to delegate.
