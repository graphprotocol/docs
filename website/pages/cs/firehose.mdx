Firehose is a new technology developed by StreamingFast working with The Graph Foundation. The product provides **previously unseen capabilities and speeds for indexing blockchain data** using a files-based and streaming-first approach.

Firehose extracts, transforms and saves blockchain data in a highly performant file-based strategy. Blockchain developers can then access data extracted by Firehose through binary data streams. Firehose is intended to stand as a replacement for The Graphâ€™s original blockchain data extraction layer.
