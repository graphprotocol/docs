title: Querying from an Application
---

Once a subgraph is deployed to the Subgraph Studio or to The Graph Explorer, you will be given the endpoint for your GraphQL API that should look something like this:

**Subgraph Studio (testing endpoint)**

```sh
Queries (HTTP)
https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<ID>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/<VERSION>
```

**Graph Explorer**

```sh
Queries (HTTP)
https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<API_KEY>/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_ID>
```

Using the GraphQL endpoint, you can use various GraphQL Client libraries to query the subgraph and populate your app with the data indexed by the subgraph.

Here are a couple of the more popular GraphQL clients in the ecosystem and how to use them:

## GraphQL clients

### Graph client

The Graph is providing it own GraphQL client, `graph-client` that supports unique features such as:

- Cross-chain Subgraph Handling: Querying from multiple subgraphs in a single query
- [Automatic Block Tracking](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/blob/main/packages/block-tracking/README.md)
- [Automatic Pagination](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/blob/main/packages/auto-pagination/README.md)
- Fully typed result

Also integrated with popular GraphQL clients such as Apollo and URQL and compatible with all environments (React, Angular, Node.js, React Native), using `graph-client` will give you the best experience for interacting with The Graph.

Let's look at how to fetch data from a subgraph with `graphql-client`.

To get started, make sure to install The Graph Client CLI in your project:

```sh
yarn add -D @graphprotocol/client-cli
# or, with NPM:
npm install --save-dev @graphprotocol/client-cli
```

Define your query in a `.graphql` file (or inlined in your `.js` or `.ts` file):

```graphql
query ExampleQuery {
  # this one is coming from compound-v2
  markets(first: 7) {
    borrowRate
    cash
    collateralFactor
  }
  # this one is coming from uniswap-v2
  pair(id: "0x00004ee988665cdda9a1080d5792cecd16dc1220") {
    id
    token0 {
      id
      symbol
      name
    }
    token1 {
      id
      symbol
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Then, create a configuration file (called `.graphclientrc.yml`) and point to your GraphQL endpoints provided by The Graph, for example:

```yaml
# .graphclientrc.yml
sources:
  - name: uniswapv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/uniswap/uniswap-v2
  - name: compoundv2
    handler:
      graphql:
        endpoint: https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/graphprotocol/compound-v2

documents:
  - ./src/example-query.graphql
```

Running the following The Graph Client CLI command will generate typed and ready to use JavaScript code:

```sh
graphclient build
```

Finally, update your `.ts` file to use the generated typed GraphQL documents:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
// ...
// we import types and typed-graphql document from the generated code (`..graphclient/`)
import { ExampleQueryDocument, ExampleQueryQuery, execute } from '../.graphclient'

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState<ExampleQueryQuery>()

  useEffect(() => {
    execute(ExampleQueryDocument, {}).then((result) => {
      setData(result?.data)
    })
  }, [setData])
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>Graph Client Example</p>
        <fieldset>
          {data && (
            <form>
              <label>Data</label>
              <br />
              <textarea value={JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)} readOnly rows={25} />
            </form>
          )}
        </fieldset>
      </header>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

**⚠️ Important notice**

`graph-client` is perfectly integrated with other GraphQL clients such as Apollo client, URQL, or React Query; you will [find examples in the official repository](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client/tree/main/examples).

However, if you choose to go with another client, keep in mind that **you won't be able to get to use Cross-chain Subgraph Handling or Automatic Pagination, which are core features for querying The Graph**.

### Apollo client

[Apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) is the ubiquitous GraphQL client on the front-end ecosystem.

Available for React, Angular, Vue, Ember, iOS, and Android, Apollo Client, although the heaviest client, brings many features to build advanced UI on top of GraphQL:

- advanced error handling
- pagination
- data prefetching
- optimistic UI
- local state management

Let's look at how to fetch data from a subgraph with Apollo client in a web project.

First, install `@apollo/client` and `graphql`:

```sh
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

Then you can query the API with the following code:

```javascript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client'

const APIURL = 'https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query//<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/'

const tokensQuery = `
  query {
    tokens {
      id
      tokenID
      contentURI
      metadataURI
    }
  }
`

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: APIURL,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
})

client
  .query({
    query: gql(tokensQuery),
  })
  .then((data) => console.log('Subgraph data: ', data))
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('Error fetching data: ', err)
  })
```

To use variables, you can pass in a `variables` argument to the query:

```javascript
const tokensQuery = `
  query($first: Int, $orderBy: BigInt, $orderDirection: String) {
    tokens(
      first: $first, orderBy: $orderBy, orderDirection: $orderDirection
    ) {
      id
      tokenID
      contentURI
      metadataURI
    }
  }
`

client
  .query({
    query: gql(tokensQuery),
    variables: {
      first: 10,
      orderBy: 'createdAtTimestamp',
      orderDirection: 'desc',
    },
  })
  .then((data) => console.log('Subgraph data: ', data))
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('Error fetching data: ', err)
  })
```

### URQL

Another option is [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) which is available within Node.js, React/Preact, Vue, and Svelte environments, with more advanced features:

- Flexible cache system
- Extensible design (easing adding new capabilities on top of it)
- Lightweight bundle (~5x lighter than Apollo Client)
- Support for file uploads and offline mode

Let's look at how to fetch data from a subgraph with URQL in a web project.

First, install `urql` and `graphql`:

```sh
npm install urql graphql
```

Then you can query the API with the following code:

```javascript
import { createClient } from 'urql'

const APIURL = 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/username/subgraphname'

const tokensQuery = `
  query {
    tokens {
      id
      tokenID
      contentURI
      metadataURI
    }
  }
`

const client = createClient({
  url: APIURL,
})

const data = await client.query(tokensQuery).toPromise()
```
