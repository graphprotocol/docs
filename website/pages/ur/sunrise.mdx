## What is the Sunrise of Decentralized Data?

The Sunrise of Decentralized Data is an initiative spearheaded by Edge & Node. The goal is to enable subgraph developers to seamlessly upgrade to The Graph’s decentralized network.

یہ منصوبہ گراف ایکو سسٹم کی کئی پچھلی پیشرفتوں پر مبنی ہے، بشمول نئے شائع شدہ سب گرافس پر کیوریز پیش کرنے کے لیے ایک اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر، اور نئے بلاکچین نیٹ ورکس کو گراف میں ضم کرنے کی صلاحیت.

### What are the phases of the Sunrise?

**Sunray**: Enable support for hosted service chains, introduce a seamless upgrade flow, offer a free plan on The Graph Network, and provide simple payment options.\
**Sunbeam**: The upgrade window that subgraph developers will have to upgrade their hosted service subgraphs to The Graph Network. This window will end on June 12th 2024.\
**Sunrise**: Hosted service endpoints will no longer be available after June 12th 2024.

### When will hosted service subgraphs no longer be available?

Hosted service endpoints will no longer be available after June 12th, 2024. Developers will no longer be able to deploy new versions, and query endpoints will no longer be available to query.

### Will my hosted service subgraph be supported on The Graph Network?

Yes, the upgrade Indexer will automatically support all hosted service subgraphs published to The Graph Network for a seamless upgrade experience.

### How do I upgrade my hosted service subgraph?

> Note: Upgrading a subgraph to The Graph Network cannot be undone.

<VideoEmbed youtube="hCmX5Dlhdjw" />

To upgrade a hosted service subgraph, you can visit the subgraph dashboard on the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service).

1. Select the subgraph(s) you want to upgrade.
2. Select the receiving wallet (the wallet that will become the owner of the subgraph).
3. Click the "Upgrade" button.

Once your subgraph is published, the [upgrade Indexer](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) will begin serving queries on it. Once you have generated an API key, you can begin making queries immediately. [Learn more](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph/#what-next).

### How can I get support with the upgrade process?

The Graph community is here to support developers as they move to The Graph Network. Join The Graph's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) and request help in the #upgrade-decentralized-network channel.

### How can I ensure high quality of service and redundancy for subgraphs on The Graph Network?

All subgraphs will be supported by the upgrade indexer. In order to attract additional Indexers for redundancy and improved quality of service, developers can add curation signal to subgraphs eligible for indexing rewards. [Learn more about adding signal to your subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph).

Subgraphs which are not eligible for indexing rewards may struggle to attract further Indexers. For example, indexing rewards may not be available for subgraphs on certain chains (check support [here](/developing/supported-networks)).

Members from these blockchain communities are encouraged to integrate their chain through the [Chain Integration Process](/chain-integration-overview/).

### How do I publish new versions to the network?

You can deploy new versions of your subgraph directly to Subgraph Studio, which provides a testing environment, before publishing to the network for production usage. Subgraph Studio has a different deployment command and requires a `version-label` for each new deployment.

1. Upgrade to the latest version of [graph-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
2. Update your deploy command

```sh
# Authorize with Subgraph Studio, available on your subgraph page
## Alternativel pass this into the deploy command as --access-token (see below)
graph auth --studio <deploy-key>

# Deploy to Subgraph Studio
## Unlike the hosted service, the name is just the subgraph name (no github id)
## If using `--node` directly, you can pass in https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
graph deploy --studio --version <version> --access-token <deploy-key> <subgraph-name>
```

This new version will then sync in Subgraph Studio, a testing and sandbox environment. When you are ready to move a new version to production, you can [publish the subgraph version](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph).

> Publishing requires Arbitrum ETH - upgrading your subgraph also airdrops a small amount to facilitate your first protocol interactions 🧑‍🚀

### I use a subgraph developed by someone else, how can I make sure that my service isn't interrupted?

When the owner has upgraded their subgraph, you will be able to easily go from the subgraph's hosted service page to the corresponding subgraph on The Graph Network, and update your application to use the new subgraph's query URL. [Learn more](/querying/querying-the-graph).

Around the start of June, Edge & Node will automatically upgrade actively queried subgraphs. This will give any third-party data consumers an opportunity to move subgraph endpoints to The Graph Network before June 12th. The subgraph owners will still be able to claim these subgraphs on the network using the hosted service upgrade flow.

### What happens if I don't upgrade my subgraph?

Subgraphs will be queryable on the hosted service until June 12th, after which query endpoints will no longer be available and owners will not be able to deploy new versions. Owners will still be able to upgrade their subgraphs to The Graph Network at any time, even after June 12th.

### How can I get started querying subgraphs on The Graph Network?

You can explore available subgraphs on [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer). [Learn more about querying subgraphs on The Graph](/querying/querying-the-graph).

## About the Upgrade Indexer

### What is the upgrade Indexer?

The upgrade Indexer is designed to improve the experience of upgrading subgraphs from the hosted service to The Graph Network and to support new versions of existing subgraphs that have not yet been indexed.

The upgrade Indexer aims to bootstrap chains that don't have indexing rewards yet on The Graph Network and to serve as a fallback for new subgraph versions. The goal is to ensure that an Indexer is available to serve queries as quickly as possible after a subgraph is published.

### What chains does the upgrade Indexer support?

The upgrade Indexer supports chains that were previously only available on the hosted service.

### ایج اور نوڈ اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر کیوں چلا رہا ہے؟

Edge & Node has historically maintained the hosted service and, as a result, has already synced data for hosted service subgraphs.

All Indexers are encouraged to become upgrade Indexers as well. However, note that operating an upgrade Indexer is primarily a public service to support new subgraphs and additional chains that lack indexing rewards before they are approved by The Graph Council.

### What does the upgrade indexer mean for existing Indexers?

Chains that were previously only supported on the hosted service will now be available to developers on The Graph Network without indexing rewards at first, but it will unlock query fees for any Indexer that is interested. This should lead to an increase in the number of subgraphs being published on The Graph Network, providing more opportunities for Indexers to index and serve these subgraphs in return for query fees, even before indexing rewards are enabled for a chain.

اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر انڈیکسر کمیونٹی کو گراف نیٹ ورک پر سب گرافس اور نئی چینز کی ممکنہ مانگ کے بارے میں معلومات بھی فراہم کرتا ہے.

### ڈیلیگیٹرز کے لیے اس کا کیا مطلب ہے؟

اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر ڈیلیگیٹرز کے لیے ایک طاقتور موقع فراہم کرتا ہے۔ چونکہ زیادہ سب گراف ہوسٹڈ سروس سے گراف نیٹ ورک میں اپ گریڈ ہوتے ہیں، ڈیلیگیٹرز نیٹ ورک کی بڑھتی ہوئی سرگرمی سے فائدہ اٹھاتے ہیں.

### کیا اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر انعامات کے لیے موجودہ انڈیکسرز کا مقابلہ کرے گا؟

نہیں، اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر صرف فی سب گراف کم از کم رقم مختص کرے گا اور انڈیکسنگ انعامات جمع نہیں کرے گا.

It operates on an “as needed” basis and serves as a fallback until sufficient service quality is achieved by at least 3 other Indexers in the network for respective chains and subgraphs.

### یہ سب گراف ڈویلپرز کو کیسے متاثر کرے گا؟

Subgraph developers will be able to query their subgraphs on The Graph Network almost immediately after upgrading from the hosted service or publishing from Subgraph Studio, as no lead time will be required for indexing.

### اس سے ڈیٹا صارفین کو کیسے فائدہ ہوتا ہے؟

The upgrade Indexer enables chains on the network that were previously only supported on the hosted service. Therefore, it widens the scope and availability of data that can be queried on the network.

### اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر کیوریز کی قیمت کیسے لگائے گا؟

اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر مارکیٹ ریٹ پر کیوریز کی قیمت لگائے گا تاکہ کیوری فیس مارکیٹ پر اثر انداز نہ ہو.

### اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر کے سب گراف کو سپورٹ کرنے سے روکنے کے لیے کیا معیار ہیں؟

اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر ایک سب گراف پر کام کرے گا جب تک کہ یہ کم از کم 3 دیگر انڈیکسرز کے ذریعہ پیش کردہ مستقل کیوریز کے ساتھ کافی اور کامیابی کے ساتھ پیش نہیں کیا جاتا ہے.

مزید برآں، اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر سب گراف کو سپورٹ کرنا بند کر دے گا اگر اس سے پچھلے 30 دنوں میں کیوری نہیں کیا گیا ہے.

Other Indexers are incentivized to support subgraphs with ongoing query volume. The query volume to the upgrade Indexer should trend towards zero, as it will have a small allocation size, and other Indexers will be chosen for queries ahead of it.

## About The Graph Network

### کیا مجھے اپنا انفراسٹرکچر چلانے کی ضرورت ہے؟

No, all infrastructure is operated by independent Indexers on The Graph Network, including the upgrade Indexer ([read more below](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer)).

You can use [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to create, test, and publish your subgraph. All hosted service users must upgrade their subgraph to The Graph Network before June 12th, 2024.

The [Sunrise Upgrade Indexer](/sunrise/#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) ensures the indexing of all subgraphs. However, signaling GRT on a particular subgraph will draw more indexers to it. This incentivization of additional Indexers through curation aims to enhance the quality of service for queries by reducing latency and enhancing network availability.

When signaling, Curators can decide to signal on a specific version of the subgraph or to signal using auto-migrate. If they signal using auto-migrate, a curator’s shares will always be updated to the latest version published by the developer. If they decide to signal on a specific version instead, shares will always stay on that specific version.

To assist teams that are transitioning subgraphs from the hosted service to the Graph Network, curation support is now available. If you require assistance with curation to enhance the quality of service, please send a request to the Edge & Node team at support@thegraph.zendesk.com and specify the subgraphs you need assistance with.

ایک بار جب آپ کا سب گراف مناسب کیوریشن سگنل تک پہنچ جاتا ہے اور دوسرے انڈیکسرز اس کی حمایت کرنا شروع کر دیتے ہیں، تو اپ گریڈ انڈیکسر آہستہ آہستہ ختم ہو جائے گا، جس سے دوسرے انڈیکسرز کو انڈیکسنگ انعامات اور کیوری کی فیسیں جمع کرنے کی اجازت مل جائے گی.

### کیا مجھے اپنے انڈیکسنگ انفراسٹرکچر کی میزبانی کرنی چاہئے؟

گراف نیٹ ورک کے استعمال کے مقابلے میں آپ کے اپنے پروجیکٹ کے لیے انفراسٹرکچر چلانا [نمایاں طور پر زیادہ وسائل والا](/network/benefits/) ہے.

Additionally, The Graph Network is significantly more robust, reliable, and cost-efficient than anything provided by a single organization or team. Hundreds of independent Indexers around the world power The Graph Network, ensuring safety, security, and redundancy.

یہ کہا جا رہا ہے، اگر آپ ابھی بھی [گراف نوڈ](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) چلانے میں دلچسپی رکھتے ہیں، تو گراف نیٹ ورک میں شامل ہونے پر غور کریں [بطور انڈیکسر](https://thegraph. com/blog/how-to-become-indexer/) اپنے سب گراف اور دیگر پر ڈیٹا پیش کرکے انڈیکسنگ انعامات اور کیوری کی فیس حاصل کرنے کے لیے.

### کیا مجھے سینٹرلائزڈ انڈیکسنگ فراہم کنندہ استعمال کرنا چاہیے؟

If you are building in web3, the moment you use a centralized indexing provider, you are giving them control of your dapp and data. The Graph’s decentralized network offers [superior quality of service](https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/), reliability with unbeatable uptime thanks to node redundancy, significantly [lower costs](/network/benefits/), and keeps you from being hostage at the data layer.

With The Graph Network, your subgraph is public and anyone can query it openly, which increases the usage and network effects of your dapp.

Additionally, Subgraph Studio provides 100,000 free monthly queries on the Free Plan, before payment is needed for additional usage.

سینٹرلائزڈ ہوسٹنگ پر گراف کے فوائد کی تفصیلی بریک ڈاؤن یہ ہے:

- **لچک اور ریڈینڈینسی**: ڈیسینٹرالائزڈ نظام اپنی تقسیم شدہ نوعیت کی وجہ سے فطری طور پر زیادہ مضبوط اور لچکدار ہوتے ہیں۔ ڈیٹا کسی ایک سرور یا مقام پر محفوظ نہیں ہوتا ہے۔ اس کے بجائے، یہ دنیا بھر میں سینکڑوں آزاد انڈیکسرز کے ذریعہ پیش کیا جاتا ہے۔ اگر ایک نوڈ ناکام ہو جاتا ہے تو یہ ڈیٹا کے ضائع ہونے یا سروس میں رکاوٹ کا خطرہ کم کرتا ہے، جس سے غیر معمولی اپ ٹائم ہوتا ہے (99.99%).

- **سروس کا معیار**: متاثر کن اپ ٹائم کے علاوہ، گراف نیٹ ورک میں ~106ms میڈین کیوری کی رفتار (لیٹنسی) اور میزبان متبادل کے مقابلے میں کیوری کی کامیابی کی اعلی شرحیں شامل ہیں۔ مزید پڑھیں [اس بلاگ] میں (https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/).

- **Censorship Resistance**: Centralized systems are targets for censorship, either through regulatory pressures or network attacks. In contrast, the dispersed architecture of decentralized systems makes them much harder to censor, which ensures continuous data availability.

- **Transparency and Trust**: Decentralized systems operate openly, enabling anyone to independently verify the data. This transparency builds trust among network participants because they can verify the system's integrity without relying on a central authority.

جس طرح آپ نے اپنے بلاکچین نیٹ ورک کو اس کی ڈیسینٹرالائزڈ، سیکورٹی اور شفافیت کے لیے منتخب کیا ہے، اسی طرح گراف نیٹ ورک کا انتخاب انہی اصولوں کی توسیع ہے۔ اپنے ڈیٹا انفراسٹرکچر کو ان اقدار کے ساتھ سیدھ میں لا کر، آپ ایک مربوط، لچکدار، اور اعتماد پر مبنی ترقیاتی ماحول کو یقینی بناتے ہیں.
