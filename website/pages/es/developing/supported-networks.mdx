\* Preliminary network support via the [upgrade Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/upgrade-indexer/)  
&#8288;<sup>†</sup> Supports Substreams

The hosted service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints.

Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are being deprecated. Read more on the [Ethereum Foundation Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/06/21/testnet-deprecation). As of Feb 25th 2023, Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are no longer supported by the hosted service. Goerli will be maintained by client developers post-merge, and is also supported by the hosted service. Developers who currently use Ropsten, Rinkeby or Kovan as their staging/testing environment are encouraged to migrate to Goerli.

Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier. `xdai` is still supported for existing hosted service subgraphs.

For a full list of which features are supported on the decentralized network, see [this page](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md).

Substreams-powered subgraphs indexing `mainnet` Ethereum are supported on the Subgraph Studio and decentralized network.

## Graph Node

If your preferred network isn't supported on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph Node también puede indexar otros protocolos, a través de una integración Firehose. Se han creado integraciones de Firehose para redes basadas en NEAR, Arweave y Cosmos.
