Firehose is a new technology developed by StreamingFast working with The Graph Foundation. The product provides **previously unseen capabilities and speeds for indexing blockchain data** using a files-based and streaming-first approach.

The Graph merges into Go Ethereum/geth with the adoption of [Live Tracer with v1.14.0 release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.14.0).

Firehose extracts, transforms and saves blockchain data in a highly performant file-based strategy. Blockchain developers can then access data extracted by Firehose through binary data streams. Firehose is intended to stand as a replacement for The Graph’s original blockchain data extraction layer.
