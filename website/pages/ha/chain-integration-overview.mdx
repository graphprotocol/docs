title: Chain Integration Process Overview
---

A transparent and governance-based integration process was designed for blockchain teams seeking [integration with The Graph protocol](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0057-chain-integration-process/4468). It is a 3-phase process, as summarised below.

## Stage 1. Technical Integration

- Teams work on a Graph Node integration and Firehose for non-EVM based chains. [Here's how](/new-chain-integration/).
- Teams initiate the protocol integration process by creating a Forum thread [here](https://forum.thegraph.com/c/governance-gips/new-chain-support/71) (New Data Sources sub-category under Governance & GIPs). Using the default Forum template is mandatory.

## Stage 2. Integration Validation

- Teams collaborate with core developers, Graph Foundation and operators of GUIs and network gateways, such as [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/), to ensure a smooth integration process. This involves providing the necessary backend infrastructure, such as the integrating chain's JSON RPC or Firehose endpoints. Teams wanting to avoid self-hosting such infrastructure can leverage The Graph's community of node operators (Indexers) to do so, which the Foundation can help with.
- Graph Indexers test the integration on The Graph's testnet.
- Core developers and Indexers monitor stability, performance, and data determinism.

## Stage 3. Mainnet Integration

- Teams propose mainnet integration by submitting a Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) and initiating a pull request (PR) on the [feature support matrix](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md) (more details on the link).
- The Graph Council reviews the request and approves mainnet support, providing a successful Stage 2 and positive community feedback.

If the process looks daunting, don't worry! The Graph Foundation is committed to supporting integrators by fostering collaboration, offering essential information, and guiding them through various stages, including navigating governance processes such as Graph Improvement Proposals (GIPs) and pull requests. If you have questions, please reach out to [info@thegraph.foundation](mailto:info@thegraph.foundation) or through Discord (either Pedro, The Graph Foundation member, IndexerDAO, or other core developers).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How does this relate to the [World of Data Services GIP](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0042-a-world-of-data-services/3761)?

This process is related to the Subgraph Data Service, applicable only to new Subgraph `Data Sources`.

### 2. What happens if Firehose & Substreams support comes after the network is supported on mainnet?

This would only impact protocol support for indexing rewards on Substreams-powered subgraphs. The new Firehose implementation would need testing on testnet, following the methodology outlined for Stage 2 in this GIP. Similarly, assuming the implementation is performant and reliable, a PR on the [Feature Support Matrix](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md) would be required (`Substreams data sources` Subgraph Feature), as well as a new GIP for protocol support for indexing rewards. Anyone can create the PR and GIP; the Foundation would help with Council approval.

### 3. How much time will this process take?

The time to mainnet is expected to be several weeks, varying based on the time of integration development, whether additional research is required, testing and bug fixes, and, as always, the timing of the governance process that requires community feedback.

Protocol support for indexing rewards depends on the stakeholders' bandwidth to proceed with testing, feedback gathering, and handling contributions to the core codebase, if applicable. This is directly tied to the integration's maturity and how responsive the integration team is (who may or may not be the team behind the RPC/Firehose implementation). The Foundation is here to help support throughout the whole process.

### 4. How will priorities be handled?

Similar to #3, it will depend on overall readiness and involved stakeholders' bandwidth. For example, a new chain with a brand new Firehose implementation may take longer than integrations that have already been battle-tested or are farther along in the governance process. This is especially true for chains previously supported on the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service) or those relying on already tested stacks.
