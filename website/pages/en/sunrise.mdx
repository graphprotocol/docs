## What is the Sunrise of Decentralized Data?

The Sunrise of Decentralized Data is an initiative spearheaded by Edge & Node. The goal is to enable subgraph developers to seamlessly upgrade to The Graph‚Äôs decentralized network.

This plan draws on many previous developments from The Graph ecosystem, including an upgrade Indexer to serve queries on newly published subgraphs, and the ability to integrate new blockchain networks to The Graph.

### What are the phases of the Sunrise?

**Sunray**: Enable support for hosted service chains, introduce a seamless upgrade flow, offer a free plan on The Graph Network, and provide simple payment options.  
**Sunbeam**: The upgrade window that subgraph developers will have to upgrade their hosted service subgraphs to The Graph Network. This window will end on June 12th 2024.  
**Sunrise**: Hosted service endpoints will no longer be available after June 12th 2024.

## Upgrading subgraphs to The Graph Network

### When will hosted service subgraphs no longer be available?

Hosted service endpoints will no longer be available after June 12th, 2024. Developers will no longer be able to deploy new versions, and query endpoints will no longer be available to query.

### Will my hosted service subgraph be supported on The Graph Network?

Yes, the upgrade Indexer will automatically support all hosted service subgraphs published to The Graph Network for a seamless upgrade experience.

### How do I upgrade my hosted service subgraph?

> Note: Upgrading a subgraph to The Graph Network cannot be undone.

<VideoEmbed youtube="hCmX5Dlhdjw" />

To upgrade a hosted service subgraph, you can visit the subgraph dashboard on the [hosted service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service).

1. Select the subgraph(s) you want to upgrade.
2. Select the receiving wallet (the wallet that will become the owner of the subgraph).
3. Click the "Upgrade" button.

Once your subgraph is published, the [upgrade Indexer](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) will begin serving queries on it. Once you have generated an API key, you can begin making queries immediately. [Learn more](/cookbook/upgrading-a-subgraph/#what-next).

### How can I get support with the upgrade process?

The Graph community is here to support developers as they move to The Graph Network. Join The Graph's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) and request help in the #upgrade-decentralized-network channel.

### How can I ensure high quality of service and redundancy for subgraphs on The Graph Network?

All subgraphs will be supported by the upgrade indexer. In order to attract additional Indexers for redundancy and improved quality of service, developers can add curation signal to subgraphs eligible for indexing rewards. [Learn more about adding signal to your subgraph](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph/#adding-signal-to-your-subgraph).

Subgraphs which are not eligible for indexing rewards may struggle to attract further Indexers. For example, indexing rewards may not be available for subgraphs on certain chains (check support [here](/developing/supported-networks)).

Members from these blockchain communities are encouraged to integrate their chain through the [Chain Integration Process](/chain-integration-overview/).

### How do I publish new versions to the network?

You can deploy new versions of your subgraph directly to Subgraph Studio, which provides a testing environment, before publishing to the network for production usage. Subgraph Studio has a different deployment command and requires a `version-label` for each new deployment.

1. Upgrade to the latest version of [graph-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
2. Update your deploy command

```sh
#¬†Authorize with Subgraph Studio, available on your subgraph page
## Alternativel pass this into the deploy command as --access-token (see below)
graph auth --studio <deploy-key>

# Deploy to Subgraph Studio
## Unlike the hosted service, the name is just the subgraph name (no github id)
## If using `--node` directly, you can pass in https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
graph deploy --studio --version <version> --access-token <deploy-key> <subgraph-name>
```

This new version will then sync in Subgraph Studio, a testing and sandbox environment. When you are ready to move a new version to production, you can [publish the subgraph version](/publishing/publishing-a-subgraph).

> Publishing requires Arbitrum ETH - upgrading your subgraph also airdrops a small amount to facilitate your first protocol interactions üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

### I use a subgraph developed by someone else, how can I make sure that my service isn't interrupted?

When the owner has upgraded their subgraph, you will be able to easily go from the subgraph's hosted service page to the corresponding subgraph on The Graph Network, and update your application to use the new subgraph's query URL. [Learn more](/querying/querying-the-graph).

Around the start of June, Edge & Node will automatically upgrade actively queried subgraphs. This will give any third-party data consumers an opportunity to move subgraph endpoints to The Graph Network before June 12th. The subgraph owners will still be able to claim these subgraphs on the network using the hosted service upgrade flow.

### What happens if I don't upgrade my subgraph?

Subgraphs will be queryable on the hosted service until June 12th, after which query endpoints will no longer be available and owners will not be able to deploy new versions. Owners will still be able to upgrade their subgraphs to The Graph Network at any time, even after June 12th.

### How can I get started querying subgraphs on The Graph Network?

You can explore available subgraphs on [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer). [Learn more about querying subgraphs on The Graph](/querying/querying-the-graph).

## About the Upgrade Indexer

### What is the upgrade Indexer?

The upgrade Indexer is designed to improve the experience of upgrading subgraphs from the hosted service to The Graph Network and to support new versions of existing subgraphs that have not yet been indexed.

The upgrade Indexer aims to bootstrap chains that don't have indexing rewards yet on The Graph Network and to serve as a fallback for new subgraph versions. The goal is to ensure that an Indexer is available to serve queries as quickly as possible after a subgraph is published.

### What chains does the upgrade Indexer support?

The upgrade Indexer supports chains that were previously only available on the hosted service.

Find a comprehensive list of supported chains [here](/developing/supported-networks/).

### Why is Edge & Node running the upgrade Indexer?

Edge & Node has historically maintained the hosted service and, as a result, has already synced data for hosted service subgraphs.

All Indexers are encouraged to become upgrade Indexers as well. However, note that operating an upgrade Indexer is primarily a public service to support new subgraphs and additional chains that lack indexing rewards before they are approved by The Graph Council.

### What does the upgrade indexer mean for existing Indexers?

Chains that were previously only supported on the hosted service will now be available to developers on The Graph Network without indexing rewards at first, but it will unlock query fees for any Indexer that is interested. This should lead to an increase in the number of subgraphs being published on The Graph Network, providing more opportunities for Indexers to index and serve these subgraphs in return for query fees, even before indexing rewards are enabled for a chain.

The upgrade Indexer also provides the Indexer community with information about potential demand for subgraphs and new chains on The Graph Network.

### What does this mean for Delegators?

The upgrade Indexer offers a powerful opportunity for Delegators. As more subgraphs are upgraded from the hosted service to The Graph Network, Delegators stand to benefit from the increased network activity.

### Will the upgrade Indexer compete with existing Indexers for rewards?

No, the upgrade Indexer will only allocate the minimum amount per subgraph and will not collect indexing rewards.

It operates on an ‚Äúas needed‚Äù basis and serves as a fallback until sufficient service quality is achieved by at least 3 other Indexers in the network for respective chains and subgraphs.

### How will this affect subgraph developers?

Subgraph developers will be able to query their subgraphs on The Graph Network almost immediately after upgrading from the hosted service or publishing from Subgraph Studio, as no lead time will be required for indexing.

### How does this benefit data consumers?

The upgrade Indexer enables chains on the network that were previously only supported on the hosted service. Therefore, it widens the scope and availability of data that can be queried on the network.

### How will the upgrade Indexer price queries?

The upgrade Indexer will price queries at the market rate so as not to influence the query fee market.

### What are the criteria for the upgrade Indexer to stop supporting a subgraph?

The upgrade Indexer will serve a subgraph until it is sufficiently and successfully served with consistent queries served by at least 3 other Indexers.

Furthermore, the upgrade Indexer will stop supporting a subgraph if it has not been queried in the last 30 days.

Other Indexers are incentivized to support subgraphs with ongoing query volume. The query volume to the upgrade Indexer should trend towards zero, as it will have a small allocation size, and other Indexers will be chosen for queries ahead of it.

## About The Graph Network

### Do I need to run my own infrastructure?

No, all infrastructure is operated by independent Indexers on The Graph Network, including the upgrade Indexer ([read more below](#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer)).

You can use [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) to create, test, and publish your subgraph. All hosted service users must upgrade their subgraph to The Graph Network before June 12th, 2024.

The [Sunrise Upgrade Indexer](/sunrise/#what-is-the-upgrade-indexer) ensures the indexing of all subgraphs. However, signaling GRT on a particular subgraph will draw more indexers to it. This incentivization of additional Indexers through curation aims to enhance the quality of service for queries by reducing latency and enhancing network availability.

When signaling, Curators can decide to signal on a specific version of the subgraph or to signal using auto-migrate. If they signal using auto-migrate, a curator‚Äôs shares will always be updated to the latest version published by the developer. If they decide to signal on a specific version instead, shares will always stay on that specific version.

To assist teams that are transitioning subgraphs from the hosted service to the Graph Network, curation support is now available. If you require assistance with curation to enhance the quality of service, please send a request to the Edge & Node team at support@thegraph.zendesk.com and specify the subgraphs you need assistance with.

Once your subgraph has reached adequate curation signal and other Indexers begin supporting it, the upgrade Indexer will gradually taper off, allowing other Indexers to collect indexing rewards and query fees.

### Should I host my own indexing infrastructure?

Running infrastructure for your own project is [significantly more resource intensive](/network/benefits/) when compared to using The Graph Network.

Additionally, The Graph Network is significantly more robust, reliable, and cost-efficient than anything provided by a single organization or team. Hundreds of independent Indexers around the world power The Graph Network, ensuring safety, security, and redundancy.

That being said, if you‚Äôre still interested in running a [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node), consider joining The Graph Network [as an Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/how-to-become-indexer/) to earn indexing rewards and query fees by serving data on your subgraph and others.

### Should I use a centralized indexing provider?

If you are building in web3, the moment you use a centralized indexing provider, you are giving them control of your dapp and data. The Graph‚Äôs decentralized network offers [superior quality of service](https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/), reliability with unbeatable uptime thanks to node redundancy, significantly [lower costs](/network/benefits/), and keeps you from being hostage at the data layer.

With The Graph Network, your subgraph is public and anyone can query it openly, which increases the usage and network effects of your dapp.

Additionally, Subgraph Studio provides 100,000 free monthly queries on the Free Plan, before payment is needed for additional usage.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the benefits of The Graph over centralized hosting:

- **Resilience and Redundancy**: Decentralized systems are inherently more robust and resilient due to their distributed nature. Data isn't stored on a single server or location. Instead, it's served by hundreds of independent Indexers around the globe. This reduces the risk of data loss or service interruptions if one node fails, leading to exceptional uptime (99.99%).

- **Quality of Service**: In addition to the impressive uptime, The Graph Network features a ~106ms median query speed (latency), and higher query success rates compared to hosted alternatives. Read more in [this blog](https://thegraph.com/blog/qos-the-graph-network/).

- **Censorship Resistance**: Centralized systems are targets for censorship, either through regulatory pressures or network attacks. In contrast, the dispersed architecture of decentralized systems makes them much harder to censor, which ensures continuous data availability.

- **Transparency and Trust**: Decentralized systems operate openly, enabling anyone to independently verify the data. This transparency builds trust among network participants because they can verify the system's integrity without relying on a central authority.

Just as you've chosen your blockchain network for its decentralized nature, security, and transparency, opting for The Graph Network is an extension of those same principles. By aligning your data infrastructure with these values, you ensure a cohesive, resilient, and trust-driven development environment.
