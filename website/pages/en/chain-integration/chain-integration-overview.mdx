title: Chain integration overview
---

A transparent and governance-based integration process was designed for teams aiming to integrate data into The Graph protocol. The process is a 3-phase process, as summarised below.

## Graph Protocol Integration Process:

### 1. Technical Integration

- Teams work on a Graph Node integration. [Here’s how](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/new-chain-integration/).
- Teams initiate the protocol integration process by creating a Forum thread [here](https://forum.thegraph.com/c/governance-gips/new-chain-support/71) (New Data Sources sub-category under Governance & GIPs). Using the default Forum template is mandatory.

### 2. Integration Validation

- Teams collaborate with the Graph Foundation and GUI maintainers, such as Subgraph Studio, to ensure a smooth integration process. This involves providing the necessary backend components, which may include setting up the EVM JSON-RPC node and/or the Firehose stack for the new chain, or supporting hosting through a different team.
- Graph Indexers test the integration on The Graph's testnet.
- Core developers and Indexers monitor stability, performance, and data determinism.

### 3. Mainnet Integration

- Teams propose mainnet integration by submitting a Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) and initiating a pull request (PR) on the GitHub repository for the feature support matrix.
- The Graph Council reviews and approves mainnet support, pending a successful Stage 2 and based on community feedback.

If the process looks daunting, don’t worry! The Graph Foundation is committed to supporting integrators by fostering collaboration, offering essential information, and guiding them through various stages, including navigating governance processes such as Graph Improvement Proposals (GIPs) and pull requests.
