title: Chain Integration Guide
---

Welcome to the Chain Integration Guide, a comprehensive resource designed to guide developers and integrators through the process of integrating a new blockchain network with The Graph's decentralized network.

This guide breaks down the integration process into 3 distinct stages, each detailing the necessary steps, requirements, and best practices to ensure a seamless and efficient integration. Whether you're looking to understand the foundational requirements or seeking insights into governance and naming conventions, this guide provides the essential information to navigate the integration landscape of The Graph.

## Stage 1. Foundation & Initial Setup

An initial blockchain extraction and ingestion solution compliant with Graph Node’s protocol must exist. For Graph Node to ingest blockchain data, it must connect to an **EVM JSON RPC API** or a **Firehose-enabled blockchain**. General documentation on this integration [can be found here](/docs/en/new-chain-integration/). If the chain exposes an EVM JSON-RPC, integration with Graph Node may be tested [by a simple Graph Node configuration change](/en/new-chain-integration/#testing-an-evm-json-rpc). For non-EVM, a Firehose-enabled chain is required. Information on how to add Firehose support to a new chain [can be found here](/en/firehose/integrate-new-chains/design-principles). Firehose support is optional but highly recommended for both [substreams](/en/substreams/README/) and [Substreams-powered subgraphs](/en/cookbook/substreams-powered-subgraphs/) support.

Integrators must provide the open-sourced solution with documentation for Indexers and Developers and a subgraph showcasing the type of data Graph Node can ingest. This is the minimum information required for a first validation by core developers or community members like IndexerDAO. Other general information required on the new data source can be found in the Forum thread's template, such as minimum hardware requirements for Indexers (RPC node and/or Firehose-enabled stack), the usual upgrade frequency of underlying nodes, and, if applicable, how Indexers may be notified of future planned hard-forks should they lead to breaking changes to the integration.

If a Firehose implementation is non-existent, and the integrator or core developers of the underlying node do not want to build one, a GRP (Graph Requests for Proposals) should first be shared in the Graph’s Forum. This way, community members could apply as lead developers and maintainers. To avoid fragmentation and potentially poorly maintained forks, the instrumentation of the blockchain’s node/client for Firehose support should happen on the recommended canonical node or client, with the help of core maintainers of such code facilitating upstream merging.

## Stage 2. Testing & Validation

For ease of onboarding of users to the Graph's decentralized network, subgraph developers and consumers can currently deploy and consume subgraphs for free in a rate-limited environment through [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/). This sandbox is often used for testing purposes (unsuitable for production environments) and is maintained by core developers of the protocol. Integrations will need to be supported by Subgraph Studio or similar GUIs and Gateways by either:

1. Providing the backend required for subgraph indexing (endpoints to the implemented solution from Stage 1) free of charge.
2. Provide a grant for node operators.

Teams must express their preference when creating the Forum topic. For #2, and assuming integration with the existing Subgraph Studio, Graph Foundation and Edge & Node will collaborate closely with the team to ensure a smooth integration process.

In addition, testing on Graph's testnet is also required. Core developers and Indexers will benchmark the solutions’ stability and performance by syncing different subgraphs and monitoring KPIs such as data freshness, node uptime and latency. [POIs](indexing/#what-is-a-proof-of-indexing-poi) on testnet will be monitored to ensure 0% divergence, which is a hard requirement for the Council to approve support for indexing rewards on The Graph’s decentralized network. All found data determinism issues must be resolved during the stage, led by the team seeking protocol integration.

## Stage 3. Mainnet Integration & Governance

The last stage is supporting the new blockchain on mainnet with some level of support for arbitration and indexing rewards. For this, integrators must:

1. Open a PR,updating the feature-matrix-support.md [here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md) to include support for the new data source.
2. Publish a GIP [template here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-improvement-proposals/blob/main/gips/0000-template.md) as the formal process to request Graph protocol integration. The GIP must include the proposed update to the Feature Matrix Support (the open PR) and data gathered during Stage 2 on performance, stability, and data determinism.

> **Note on the blockchain naming convention**
>
> The name of the data source to be included in the feature matrix support must follow the naming convention as specified in [GIP-0047](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-improvement-proposals/blob/main/gips/0047-chain-aliases.md). The Graph has adopted [CAIP-2 identifiers](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md), and it's important the name remains consistent across the protocol: feature matrix support, Graph Node, EBO, Graph Tooling, etc.
>
> Known CAIPs for a variety of chains can be found in the [Chain Agnostic Namespace repository](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces).

Afterward, the Graph Foundation will post the GGP (Graph Governance Proposal) on the [Graph’s Council snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/council.graphprotocol.eth). The GGP will follow the principles agreed upon in [GIP-008: Subgraph API Versioning and Feature Support](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-improvement-proposals/blob/main/gips/0008-subgraph-api-versioning-and-feature-support.md). The Graph Foundation will ensure the GGP is created and reviewed by the Graph Council. Council's ratification of the GGP will officially mark the support for the new data source on The Graph's mainnet.

> **Note on governance**
>
> The GGP vote may be preceded by a community poll, providing no rough consensus on readiness and value-added for the protocol.
>
> Core developers’ and Indexers’ confidence in the integration stability, performance, reliability, and overall demand (the focus of Stage 2) will provide the Council with the required information to proceed with the GGP vote.
