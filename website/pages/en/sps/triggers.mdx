title: Substreams Triggers
----

Substreams triggers allow you to integrate Substreams data directly into your subgraph. By importing the [Protobuf definitions](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/creating-protobuf-schemas#protobuf-overview) emitted by your Substreams module, you can receive and process this data in your subgraph's handler. This enables efficient and streamlined data handling within the subgraph framework.
