By leveraging a Substreams package (`.yaml`) as a data source, your subgraph gains access to pre-extracted, indexed blockchain data, enabling more efficient and scalable data handling, especially when dealing with large or complex blockchain networks.

This technology opens up more efficient and versatile indexing for diverse blockchain environments. For more information on how to build a Substreams-powered subgraph, [click here](./triggers.mdx).

**Public Substreams packages**

A Substreams package is a precompiled binary file that defines the specific data you want to extract from the blockchain—similar to the `mapping.ts` file in traditional subgraphs. 

Visit [substreams.dev](https://substreams.dev/) to explore a growing collection of ready-to-use Substreams packages across various blockchain networks that can be easily integrated into your subgraph. If you can’t find a suitable Substreams package and want to build your own,  click [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/substreams/) for detailed instructions on creating a custom package tailored to your needs.
