## The Graph's Decentralized Network

The following networks are supported on The Graph's Decentralized Network:

<ListUnordered>
  {getSupportedNetworks('studio').map((network) => (
    <li key={network.cliName}>
      <CodeInline>{network.cliName}</CodeInline>
      {network.cliName === 'mainnet' ? ` (${network.name})` : null}
      {network.beta ? '*' : null}
    </li>
  ))}
</ListUnordered>

\*In beta.

## Hosted Service

> The hosted service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints.

The following networks are supported in beta on the Hosted Service:

<ListUnordered>
  {getSupportedNetworks('hostedService').map((network) => (
    <li key={network.cliName}>
      <CodeInline>{network.cliName}</CodeInline>
    </li>
  ))}
</ListUnordered>

You will **not be able** to publish a subgraph that indexes a non-mainnet network to the decentralized Graph Network in [Subgraph Studio](/deploying/subgraph-studio).

Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are being deprecated. Read more on the [Ethereum Foundation Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/06/21/testnet-deprecation). As of Feb 25th 2023, Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan are no longer supported by the Hosted Service. Goerli will be maintained by client developers post-merge, and is also supported by the Hosted Service. Developers who currently use Ropsten, Rinkeby or Kovan as their staging/testing environment are encouraged to migrate to Goerli.

Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier. `xdai` is still supported for existing hosted service subgraphs.

For a full list of which features are supported on the decentralized network, see [this page](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/networks/mainnet.md#feature-support).

## Graph Node

If your preferred network isn't support on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own Graph Node to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph Node can also index other protocols, via a Firehose integration. Firehose integrations have been created for NEAR, Arweave and Cosmos-based networks.
