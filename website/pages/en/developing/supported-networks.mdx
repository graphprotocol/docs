\* Baseline network support provided by the [upgrade Indexer](https://thegraph.com/blog/upgrade-indexer/).  
\*\* Integration with Graph Node: `evm`, `near`, `cosmos`, `osmosis` and `ar` have native handler and type support in Graph Node. Chains which are Firehose- and Substreams-compatible can leverage the generalised [Substreams-powered subgraph](/cookbook/substreams-powered-subgraphs) integration (this includes `evm` and `near` networks).  
<sup>†</sup> Supports deployment of [Substreams-powered subgraphs](/cookbook/substreams-powered-subgraphs).

- The hosted service and Subgraph Studio rely on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, for example JSON-RPC, Firehose and Substreams endpoints.
- Subgraphs indexing Gnosis Chain can now be deployed with the `gnosis` network identifier. `xdai` is still supported for existing hosted service subgraphs.
- For a full list of which features are supported on the decentralized network, see [this page](https://github.com/graphprotocol/indexer/blob/main/docs/feature-support-matrix.md).

## Running Graph Node locally

If your preferred network isn't supported on The Graph's decentralized network, you can run your own [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) to index any EVM-compatible network. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph Node can also index other protocols, via a Firehose integration. Firehose integrations have been created for NEAR, Arweave and Cosmos-based networks. Additionally, Graph Node can support Substreams-powered subgraphs for any network with Substreams support.
