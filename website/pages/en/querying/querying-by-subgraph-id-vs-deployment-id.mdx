title: Subgraph ID vs Deployment ID
---

A subgraph is identified by a Subgraph ID, and each version of the subgraph is identified by a Deployment ID.

When querying a subgraph, either ID can be used. However, there are some important differences between the two options.

## Subgraph ID

The Subgraph ID is a unique identifier for a subgraph. It remains constant across all versions of a subgraph. To query the latest version of a subgraph, it is recommended to use the Subgraph ID though there are caveats.

Be aware that querying using Subgraph ID may result in queries being responded to by an older version of the subgraph due to the newly deployed version needing time to sync. Also, newly deployed versions could introduce breaking schema changes.

Example endpoint that uses Subgraph ID:

`https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/FL3ePDCBbShPvfRJTaSCNnehiqxsPHzpLud6CpbHoeKW`

## Deployment ID

The Deployment ID is the IPFS hash of the compiled manifest file, which refers to other files on IPFS instead of relative URLs on the computer. For example, the compiled manifest can be accessed via: `https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/api/v0/cat?arg=QmQKXcNQQRdUvNRMGJiE2idoTu9fo5F5MRtKztH4WyKxED`. To change the Deployment ID, one can simply update the manifest file, such as modifying the description field as described in the [subgraph manifest documentation](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/subgraph-manifest.md#13-top-level-api).

When we make queries using the Deployment ID, we are specifying a version of that subgraph to query. This means that the version of the subgraph that responds to queries will be the version specified by the Deployment ID. Using the Deployment ID to query a specific subgraph version results in a more sophisticated and robust setup as there is full control over the subgraph version being queried. However, this results in the need of updating the query-code manually every time a new version of the subgraph is deployed.

Example endpoint that uses Deployment ID:
