Subgrounds is an intuitive Python library for querying subgraphs, built by [Playgrounds](https://playgrounds.network/). It allows you to directly connect subgraph data to a Python data environment, letting you use libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to perform data analysis!

Subgrounds offers a simple Pythonic API for building GraphQL queries, automates tedious workflows such as pagination, and empowers advanced users through controlled schema transformations.

## Getting Started

Subgrounds requires Python 3.10 or higher and is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/subgrounds/).

```bash
pip install --upgrade subgrounds
# or
python -m pip install --upgrade subgrounds
```

Once installed, you can test out subgrounds with the following query. The following example grabs a subgraph for the Aave v2 protocol and queries the top 5 markets ordered by TVL (Total Value Locked), selects their name and their TVL (in USD) and returns the data as a pandas [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html#pandas.DataFrame).

```python
from subgrounds import Subgrounds

sg = Subgrounds()

# Load the subgraph
aave_v2 = sg.load_subgraph(
    "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/messari/aave-v2-ethereum")

# Construct the query
latest_markets = aave_v2.Query.markets(
    orderBy=aave_v2.Market.totalValueLockedUSD,
    orderDirection='desc',
    first=5,
)
# Return query to a dataframe
sg.query_df([
    latest_markets.name,
    latest_markets.totalValueLockedUSD,
])
```
