Enhance your Solana built with Substreams.

## Overview

With Substreams on Solana, you can:

- Quickly index [Transaction and Instruction](./transactions.mdx) data and [Account Changes](./accountchanges.mdx). The Solana Account Changes endpoint offers both real-time and historical data, similar to other [supported endpoints](https://docs.substreams.dev/reference-material/chains-and-endpoints), with a few key differences:
  1. History for the Solana Account Changes dates as of 2025, block 310629601.
  2. The pricing model of Account Changes is based on Egress rather than Bytes Processed given the file sizes.
- Experience low-latency streaming
  - You can test Substreams latency on Solana, which is measured as block-head drift, for yourself by installing the [Substreams CLI](https://docs.substreams.dev/reference-material/substreams-cli/installing-the-cli) and running `substreams run solana-common blocks_without_votes -s -1 -o clock`.
