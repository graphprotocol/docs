title: Solana Transactions
---

In this guide, you'll learn how to initialize a Solana-based Substreams project within the Dev Container (excludes [Account Changes](./accountchanges.mdx)).

If you prefer to begin locally within your terminal rather than through the Dev Container (VS Code required), refer to the [Substreams CLI installation guide](../references/cli/installing-the-cli.md).

## Step 1: Initialize Your Solana Substreams Project

1. Open the [Dev Container](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-starter) and follow the on-screen steps to initialize your project.

2. Running `substreams init` will give you the option to choose between two Solana project options. Select the one that best fits your requirements:
   - **sol-minimal**: Creates a simple Substreams that extracts raw Solana block data and generates corresponding Rust code. This path will start you with the full raw block, you can navigate to the `substreams.yaml` (the manifest) to modify the input.
   - **sol-transactions**: Creates a Substreams that filters Solana transactions based on one or more Program IDs and/or Account IDs, using the cached [Solana Foundational Module](https://substreams.dev/streamingfast/solana-common/v0.3.0).
   - **sol-anchor-beta**: Given an Anchor IDL, create a Substreams that decodes instructions and events. If an IDL isn’t available using the `idl` subcommand within the [Anchor CLI](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/cli), you’ll need to provide it yourself.

The modules within Solana Common exclude voting transactions, to benefit from a 75% reduction in data processing size and costs, delay your stream by over 1000 blocks from head. This can be done using the [`sleep`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.sleep.html) function in Rust.

To access voting transactions, use the full Solana block, `sf.solana.type.v1.Block`, as input.

## Step 2: Visualize the Data

1. Run `substreams auth` to create your [account](https://thegraph.market/) and generate an authentication token (JWT), then pass this token back as input.

2. Now you can freely use the `substreams gui` to visualize and iterate on your extracted data.

## Step 2.5: (Optionally) Transform the Data

Within the generated directories, modify your Substreams modules to include additional filters, aggregations, and transformations, then update the manifest accordingly. To learn more about this, visit the [How-to-Guides](../how-to-guides/develop-your-own-substreams/solana/solana.md)

## Step 3: Load the Data

To make your Substreams queryable (as opposed to [direct streaming](../how-to-guides/sinks/stream/stream.md)), you can automatically generate a Subgraph (known as a [Substreams-powered subgraph](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/sps/introduction/)) or SQL-DB sink.

### Subgraph

1. Run `substreams codegen subgraph` to initialize the sink, producing the necessary files and function definitions.
2. Create your [subgraph mappings](../how-to-guides/sinks/subgraph/triggers.md) within the `mappings.ts` and associated entities within the `schema.graphql`.
3. Deploy

### SQL

1. Run `substreams codegen sql` and choose from either ClickHouse or Postgres to initialize the sink, producing the necessary files.
2. Run `substreams build` build the [Substreams:SQL](../how-to-guides/sinks/sql/sql-sink.md) sink.
3. Run `substreams-sink-sql` to sink the data into your selected SQL DB.

**Note**: Run `help` to better navigate the development environment and check the health of containers.
