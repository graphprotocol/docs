title: Substreams Dev Container
---

The Substreams Dev Container is a tool to help you build your first project. You can either run it remotely through Github codespaces or locally by cloning the [substreams-starter repository](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams-starter?tab=readme-ov-file). Inside the Dev Container, the `substreams init` command sets up a code-generated Substreams project, allowing you to easily build a subgraph or an SQL-based solution for data handling.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Docker and VS Code are up-to-date.

## First Navigating the Dev Container

Upon entering the Dev Container, you can either build or import your own `substreams.yaml` and associate modules within the minimal path, or opt for the automatically generated Substreams paths. Then running `Substreams Build` generates the Protobuf files.

- **Minimal**: Starts you with the raw block data, this path is for experienced users. You can navigate to the `substreams.yaml` to modify the input data source.
- **Non-Minimal**: Extracts filtered data using network-specific cache and Protobufs from the corresponding Foundational Modules that is built and maintained by the StreamingFast team.

To publish your work with the broader community, publish your `.spkg` to [Substreams registry](https://substreams.dev/) using:

- `substreams registry login`
- `substreams registry publish`

> Note: If you run into any problems within the Dev Container, use the `help` command to access trouble shooting tools.

## Building a Sink for Your Project

You can configure your Substreams project to query data either through a Subgraph or directly from an SQL database:

- **Subgraph**: Run `substreams codegen subgraph`. This generates a project with a basic `schema.graphql` and `mappings.ts` file. You can customize these to define entities based on the data extracted by Substreams. For more information on configuring a Subgraph sink, see the [Subgraph documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/sps/triggers).
- **SQL**: Run `substreams codegen sql` for SQL-based queries. For more information on configuring a SQL sink, refer to the [SQL documentation](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/sql-sink).

## Deployment Options

To deploy a Subgraph, you can either run the `graph-node` locally using the `deploy-local` command or deploy to Subgraph Studio by using the `deploy` command found in the `package.json` file.

## Common Errors

- When running locally, make sure to verify that all Docker containers are healthy by running the `dev-status` command.
- If you put the wrong start-block while generating your project, navigate to the `substreams.yaml` to change the block number, then re-run `substreams build`.
