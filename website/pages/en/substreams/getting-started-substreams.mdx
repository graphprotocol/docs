title: Getting Started with Substreams 
---

Integrating Substreams can be quick and easy. This guide will help you get started with consuming ready-made Substreams packages or developing your own. Substreams are permissionless. Grab a key [here](https://thegraph.market/), no personal information required, and start streaming on-chain data.

# Build

## Explore Available Substreams Packages

There are many ready-to-use Substreams packages available. You can explore these packages by visiting the [**Substreams Registry**](https://substreams.dev) and [sinking them](./developing/sinks/sinks.mdx). The registry lets you search for and find packages that meet your needs.

Once you find a package that fits your needs, you can choose how you want to consume the data:
- **[Subgraph](../sps/introduction.mdx)**: Configure an API to meet your data needs and host it on The Graph Network.
- **[SQL Database](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/sql-sink)**: Send the data to a database.
- **[Direct Streaming](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/stream)**: Stream data directly to your application.
- **[PubSub](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/pubsub)**: Send data to a PubSub topic.

## Optionally Develop Your Own Substreams

If you can't find a Substreams package that meets your specific needs, you can develop your own. Substreams are built with Rust, so youâ€™ll write functions that extract and filter the data you need from the blockchain. The easiest way to get started is by referring to the [tutorial](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials) section, enabling you to quickly filter data: 

- [EVM](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/evm)
- [Solana](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/solana)
- [Starknet](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/starknet)
- [Injective](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/on-cosmos/injective)
- [MANTRA](https://docs.substreams.dev/tutorials/intro-to-tutorials/on-cosmos/injective)

To build and optimize your Substreams from zero, use the minimal path within the [Dev Container](./developing/devcontainer.mdx) to setup your environment and follow the [How-To Guides](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/develop-your-own-substreams).
