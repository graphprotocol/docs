title: Introduction to Substreams-Powered Subgraphs
---

By using a Substreams package (`.spkg`) as a data source, your subgraph gains access to a stream of pre-indexed blockchain data. This enables more efficient and scalable data handling, especially with large or complex blockchain networks.

There are two methods of enabling this technology:

Using Substreams [triggers](/substreams/sps/triggers/): Consume from any Substreams module by importing the Protobuf model through a subgraph handler and move all your logic into a subgraph. This method creates the subgraph entities directly in the subgraph.

Using [Entity Changes](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/consume/subgraph/graph-out): By writing more of the logic into Substreams, you can consume the module's output directly into graph-node. In graph-node, you can use the Substreams data to create your subgraph entities.

It is really a matter of where you put your logic, in the subgraph or the Substreams. Keep in mind that having more of your logic in Substreams benefits from a parallelized model, whereas triggers will be linearly consumed in graph-node.
