title: Deprecate a Subgraph
---

Delete and deprecate your subgraphs using [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

## Deleting Your Subgraph

> Deleting your subgraph will remove all published versions from The Graph Network. However, it will still be visible on Graph Explorer and Subgraph Studio for users who have signaled on it.

### Step-by-Step

1. Visit your subgraph's page on Subgraph Studio.[insert image]
2. Click on the three-dots to the right of the "publish" button. [insert image]
3. Click on the option to "delete" your subgraph.[insert image]
4. Depending on the subgraph's status, you will be prompted with various options.

   - If the subgraph is not published, simply click “delete” and confirm.
   - If the subgraph is published, you will need to confirm on your wallet before the subgraph can be deleted from Studio. If a subgraph is published to multiple networks, such as testnet and mainnet, additional steps may be required.

> If the owner of the subgraph has signal on it, the signaled GRT will be returned to the owner.

Once you delete the subgraph, it will **not** be visible on Graph Explorer's homepage. However, it will be visible on the profile pages of users who have signaled on it, allowing them to remove their signal.

## Deprecating Your Subgraph

### Step-by-Step

1. Visit your subgraph's page on Subgraph Studio.
2. Click on the three-dots to the right of the "publish" button.
3. Click on the option to "deprecate" your subgraph.
4. Your subgraph will no longer appear in searches on Graph Explorer.

## Reminders

- Curators will not be able to signal on the subgraph anymore.
- Curators that already signaled on the subgraph can withdraw their signal at an average share price.
- Deprecated subgraphs will show an error message.

> If you interacted with the deprecated subgraph, you can find it in your user profile under the "Subgraphs", "Indexing", or "Curating" tab, respectively.
