- **The Graph** : Un protocole décentralisé pour l'indexation et l'interrogation des données.

- **Query** : Une requête de données. Dans le cas de The Graph, une requête est une demande de données provenant d'un subgraph à laquelle répondra un Indexeur.

- **GraphQL** : Un langage de requête pour les API et un moteur d'exécution pour répondre à ces requêtes avec vos données existantes. The Graph utilise GraphQL pour interroger les subgraphs.

- **Endpoint** : Une URL qui peut être utilisée pour interroger un subgraph. L'endpoint de test pour Subgraph Studio est `https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<ID>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/<VERSION>` et l'endpoint pour Graph Explorer est `https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<API_KEY>/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_ID>`. L'endpoint Graph Explorer est utilisé pour interroger les subgraphs sur le réseau décentralisé de The Graph.

- **Subgraph** : Une API ouverte qui extrait des données d'une blockchain, les traite et les stocke de manière à ce qu'elles puissent être facilement interrogées via GraphQL. Les développeurs peuvent créer, déployer et publier des subgraphs sur The Graph Network. Une fois indexé, le subgraph peut être interrogé par n'importe qui.

- **Indexeur** : Participants au réseau qui gèrent des nœuds d'indexation pour indexer les données des blockchains et répondre aux requêtes GraphQL.

- **Flux de revenus pour les Indexeurs** : Les Indexeurs sont récompensés en GRT par deux éléments : les remises sur les frais de requête et les récompenses pour l'indexation.

  1. **Remboursements de frais de requête** : Paiements effectués par les consommateurs de subgraphs pour avoir servi des requêtes sur le réseau.

  2. **Récompenses d'indexation** : Les récompenses que les Indexeurs reçoivent pour l'indexation des subgraphs. Les récompenses d'indexation sont générées par une nouvelle émission de 3 % de GRT par an.

- **Indexer's Self-Stake**: The amount of GRT that Indexers stake to participate in the decentralized network. The minimum is 100,000 GRT, and there is no upper limit.

- **Delegation Capacity**: The maximum amount of GRT an Indexer can accept from Delegators. Indexers can only accept up to 16x their Indexer Self-Stake, and additional delegation results in diluted rewards. For example, if an Indexer has a Self-Stake of 1M GRT, their delegation capacity is 16M. However, Indexers can increase their Delegation Capacity by increasing their Self-Stake.

- **Upgrade Indexer**: An Indexer designed to act as a fallback for subgraph queries not serviced by other Indexers on the network. The upgrade Indexer is not competitive with other Indexers.

- **Delegator**: Network participants who own GRT and delegate their GRT to Indexers. This allows Indexers to increase their stake in subgraphs on the network. In return, Delegators receive a portion of the Indexing Rewards that Indexers receive for processing subgraphs.

- **Delegation Tax**: A 0.5% fee paid by Delegators when they delegate GRT to Indexers. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Curator**: Network participants that identify high-quality subgraphs, and signal GRT on them in exchange for curation shares. When Indexers claim query fees on a subgraph, 10% is distributed to the Curators of that subgraph. There is a positive correlation between the amount of GRT signaled and the number of Indexers indexing a subgraph.

- **Curation Tax**: A 1% fee paid by Curators when they signal GRT on subgraphs. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Data Consumer**: Any application or user that queries a subgraph.

- **Subgraph Developer**: A developer who builds and deploys a subgraph to The Graph's decentralized network.

- **Subgraph Manifest**: A YAML file that describes the subgraph's GraphQL schema, data sources, and other metadata. [Here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph/blob/master/subgraph.yaml) is an example.

- **Epoch**: A unit of time within the network. Currently, one epoch is 6,646 blocks or approximately 1 day.

- **Allocation**: An Indexer can allocate their total GRT stake (including Delegators' stake) towards subgraphs that have been published on The Graph's decentralized network. Allocations can have different statuses:

  1. **Active**: An allocation is considered active when it is created onchain. This is called opening an allocation, and indicates to the network that the Indexer is actively indexing and serving queries for a particular subgraph. Active allocations accrue indexing rewards proportional to the signal on the subgraph, and the amount of GRT allocated.

  2. **Closed**: An Indexer may claim the accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph by submitting a recent, and valid, Proof of Indexing (POI). This is known as closing an allocation. An allocation must have been open for a minimum of one epoch before it can be closed. The maximum allocation period is 28 epochs. If an Indexer leaves an allocation open beyond 28 epochs, it is known as a stale allocation. When an allocation is in the **Closed** state, a Fisherman can still open a dispute to challenge an Indexer for serving false data.

- **Subgraph Studio**: A powerful dapp for building, deploying, and publishing subgraphs.

- **Fishermen**: A role within The Graph Network held by participants who monitor the accuracy and integrity of data served by Indexers. When a Fisherman identifies a query response or a POI they believe to be incorrect, they can initiate a dispute against the Indexer. If the dispute rules in favor of the Fisherman, the Indexer is slashed by losing 2.5% of their self-stake. Of this amount, 50% is awarded to the Fisherman as a bounty for their vigilance, and the remaining 50% is removed from circulation (burned). This mechanism is designed to encourage Fishermen to help maintain the reliability of the network by ensuring that Indexers are held accountable for the data they provide.

- **Arbitrators**: Arbitrators are network participants appointed through a governance process. The role of the Arbitrator is to decide the outcome of indexing and query disputes. Their goal is to maximize the utility and reliability of The Graph Network.

- **Slashing**: Indexers can have their self-staked GRT slashed for providing an incorrect POI or for serving inaccurate data. The slashing percentage is a protocol parameter currently set to 2.5% of an Indexer's self-stake. 50% of the slashed GRT goes to the Fisherman that disputed the inaccurate data or incorrect POI. The other 50% is burned.

- **Indexing Rewards**: The rewards that Indexers receive for indexing subgraphs. Indexing rewards are distributed in GRT.

- **Delegation Rewards**: The rewards that Delegators receive for delegating GRT to Indexers. Delegation rewards are distributed in GRT.

- **GRT**: The Graph's work utility token. GRT provides economic incentives to network participants for contributing to the network.

- **Proof of Indexing (POI)**: When an Indexer closes their allocation and wants to claim their accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph, they must provide a valid and recent POI. Fishermen may dispute the POI provided by an Indexer. A dispute resolved in the Fisherman's favor will result in slashing of the Indexer.

- **Graph Node**: Graph Node is the component that indexes subgraphs and makes the resulting data available to query via a GraphQL API. As such it is central to the Indexer stack, and correct operation of Graph Node is crucial to running a successful Indexer.

- **Indexer agent**: The Indexer agent is part of the Indexer stack. It facilitates the Indexer's interactions onchain, including registering on the network, managing subgraph deployments to its Graph Node(s), and managing allocations.

- **The Graph Client**: A library for building GraphQL-based dapps in a decentralized way.

- **Graph Explorer**: A dapp designed for network participants to explore subgraphs and interact with the protocol.

- **Graph CLI**: A command line interface tool for building and deploying to The Graph.

- **Cooldown Period**: The time remaining until an Indexer who changed their delegation parameters can do so again.

- **L2 Transfer Tools**: Smart contracts and UI that enable network participants to transfer network related assets from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum One. Network participants can transfer delegated GRT, subgraphs, curation shares, and Indexer's self-stake.

- **Updating a subgraph**: The process of releasing a new subgraph version with updates to the subgraph's manifest, schema, or mappings.

- **Migrating**: The process of curation shares moving from an old version of a subgraph to a new version of a subgraph (e.g. when v0.0.1 is updated to v0.0.2).
