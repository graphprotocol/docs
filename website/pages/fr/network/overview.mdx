The Graph Network is a decentralized indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data.

## How does it work?

Applications use [GraphQL](/querying/graphql-api/) to query open APIs called subgraphs and retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, developers can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

## Specifics

The Graph Network consists of Indexers, Curators, and Delegators that provide services to the network and serve data to web3 applications.

### Economics

To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants stake and use Graph Tokens ([GRT](/tokenomics)). GRT is a work utility token that is an ERC-20, which is used to allocate resources in the network.

Active Indexers, Curators, and Delegators can provide services and earn income from the network. The income they earn is proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake.
