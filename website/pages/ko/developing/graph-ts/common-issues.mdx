title: Common AssemblyScript Issues
---

There are certain [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) issues that are common to run into during subgraph development. They range in debug difficulty, however, being aware of them may help. The following is a non-exhaustive list of these issues:

- `Private` class variables are not enforced in [AssembyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/status.html#language-features). There is no way to protect class variables from being directly changed from the class object.
- Scope is not inherited into [closure functions](https://www.assemblyscript.org/status.html#on-closures), i.e. variables declared outside of closure functions cannot be used. Explanation in [Developer Highlights #3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-8AW-lVfrA&t=3243s).
