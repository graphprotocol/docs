Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology, developed for The Graph Network. Substreams enables developers to write Rust modules, composing data streams alongside the community, and provides extremely high-performance indexing by virtue of parallelization, in a streaming-first fashion.

With Substreams, you can extract data from different blockchains (Ethereum, BNB, Solana...) ultra-fast! Then, you can send to data to several locations (a Postgres database, a Mongo database, or a Subgraph).

## How Substreams Works in 4 Steps

1. **You write a Rust program, which defines the transformations that you want to apply to the blockchain data.** For example, the following Rust function extracts relevant information from an Ethereum block (number, hash, and parent hash).

```rust
fn get_my_block(blk: Block) -> Result<MyBlock, substreams::errors::Error> {
    let header = blk.header.as_ref().unwrap();

    Ok(MyBlock {
        number: blk.number,
        hash: Hex::encode(&blk.hash),
        parent_hash: Hex::encode(&header.parent_hash),
    })
}
```

2. **You wrap up your Rust program into a WASM module just by running a single CLI command.**

3. **The WASM container is sent to a Substreams endpoint for execution.** The Substreams provider feeds the WASM container with the blockchain data and the transformations are applied.

4. **You select a [sink](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/developers-guide/sink-targets), a place where you want to send the transformed data** (a Postgres database or a Subgraph, for example).

## Substreams Documentation

The official Substreams documentation is currently maintained by the StreamingFast team on the StreamingFast website (https://substreams.streamingfast.io/).

### Getting Started

- In order to develop and deploy a Substreams, [you must install the Substreams CLI](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/getting-started/installing-the-cli).
- Then, run your first Substreams by following the [Quickstart Tutorial](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/getting-started/quickstart).

### Expand Your Knowledge

- Take a look at the [Ethereum Explorer Tutorial](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/tutorials/overview/overview) to learn about the basic transformations you can create with Substreams.
