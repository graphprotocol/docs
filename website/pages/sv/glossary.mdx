- **The Graf**: En decentraliserad protokoll för indexering och frågning av data.

- **Query**: A request for data. In the case of The Graph, a query is a request for data from a subgraph that will be answered by an Indexer.

- **GraphQL**: Ett frågespråk för API:er och en körningsmiljö för att uppfylla dessa frågor med befintlig data. The Graf använder GraphQL för att fråga subgrafer.

- **Endpoint**: A URL that can be used to query a subgraph. The testing endpoint for Subgraph Studio is `https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<ID>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME>/<VERSION>` and the Graph Explorer endpoint is `https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<API_KEY>/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_ID>`. The Graph Explorer endpoint is used to query subgraphs on The Graph's decentralized network.

- **Subgraph**: An open API that extracts data from a blockchain, processes it, and stores it so that it can be easily queried via GraphQL. Developers can build, deploy, and publish subgraphs to The Graph Network. Once it is indexed, the subgraph can be queried by anyone.

- **Indexer**: Network participants that run indexing nodes to index data from blockchains and serve GraphQL queries.

- **Indexer Revenue Streams**: Indexers are rewarded in GRT with two components: query fee rebates and indexing rewards.

  1. **Query Fee Rebates**: Payments from subgraph consumers for serving queries on the network.

  2. **Indexing Rewards**: The rewards that Indexers receive for indexing subgraphs. Indexing rewards are generated via new issuance of 3% GRT annually.

- **Indexer's Self-Stake**: The amount of GRT that Indexers stake to participate in the decentralized network. The minimum is 100,000 GRT, and there is no upper limit.

- **Upgrade Indexer**: An Indexer designed to act as a fallback for subgraph queries not serviced by other Indexers on the network. The upgrade Indexer is not competitive with other Indexers.

- **Delegator**: Network participants who own GRT and delegate their GRT to Indexers. This allows Indexers to increase their stake in subgraphs on the network. In return, Delegators receive a portion of the Indexing Rewards that Indexers receive for processing subgraphs.

- **Delegationsavgift **: En avgift på 0,5% som betalas av Delegatorer när de delegerar GRT till Indexers. Det GRT som används för att betala avgiften bränns.

- **Curator**: Network participants that identify high-quality subgraphs, and signal GRT on them in exchange for curation shares. When Indexers claim query fees on a subgraph, 10% is distributed to the Curators of that subgraph. There is a positive correlation between the amount of GRT signaled and the number of Indexers indexing a subgraph.

- **Curation Tax**: A 1% fee paid by Curators when they signal GRT on subgraphs. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Data Consumer**: Any application or user that queries a subgraph.

- **Subgraph Developer**: A developer who builds and deploys a subgraph to The Graph's decentralized network.

- **Subgraph Manifest**: A YAML file that describes the subgraph's GraphQL schema, data sources, and other metadata. [Here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph/blob/master/subgraph.yaml) is an example.

- **Epoch**: A unit of time within the network. Currently, one epoch is 6,646 blocks or approximately 1 day.

- **Allocation**: An Indexer can allocate their total GRT stake (including Delegators' stake) towards subgraphs that have been published on The Graph's decentralized network. Allocations can have different statuses:

  1. **Aktiv**: En allokering anses vara aktiv när den skapas på kedjan. Detta kallas att öppna en allokering och indikerar för nätverket att Indexer aktivt indexerar och betjänar frågor för en särskild subgraf. Aktiva allokeringar ackumulerar indexbelöningar proportionellt mot signalen på subgrafen och mängden GRT som allokerats.

  2. **Closed**: An Indexer may claim the accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph by submitting a recent, and valid, Proof of Indexing (POI). This is known as closing an allocation. An allocation must have been open for a minimum of one epoch before it can be closed. The maximum allocation period is 28 epochs. If an Indexer leaves an allocation open beyond 28 epochs, it is known as a stale allocation. When an allocation is in the **Closed** state, a Fisherman can still open a dispute to challenge an Indexer for serving false data.

- **SubGraf Studio**: En kraftfull dapp för att bygga, distribuera och publicera subgrafer.

- **Fishermen**: A role within The Graph Network held by participants who monitor the accuracy and integrity of data served by Indexers. When a Fisherman identifies a query response or a POI they believe to be incorrect, they can initiate a dispute against the Indexer. If the dispute rules in favor of the Fisherman, the Indexer is slashed by losing 2.5% of their self-stake. Of this amount, 50% is awarded to the Fisherman as a bounty for their vigilance, and the remaining 50% is removed from circulation (burned). This mechanism is designed to encourage Fishermen to help maintain the reliability of the network by ensuring that Indexers are held accountable for the data they provide.

- **Arbitrators**: Arbitrators are network participants appointed through a governance process. The role of the Arbitrator is to decide the outcome of indexing and query disputes. Their goal is to maximize the utility and reliability of The Graph Network.

- **Slashing**: Indexers can have their self-staked GRT slashed for providing an incorrect POI or for serving inaccurate data. The slashing percentage is a protocol parameter currently set to 2.5% of an Indexer's self-stake. 50% of the slashed GRT goes to the Fisherman that disputed the inaccurate data or incorrect POI. The other 50% is burned.

- **Indexbelöningar**: De belöningar som Indexers får för att indexera subgrafer. Indexbelöningar distribueras i GRT.

- **Delegationsbelöningar**: De belöningar som Delegatorer får för att delegera GRT till Indexers. Delegationsbelöningar distribueras i GRT.

- **GRT**: The Graph's arbetsnytto-token. GRT tillhandahåller ekonomiska incitament för nätverksdeltagare att bidra till nätverket.

- **Proof of Indexing (POI)**: When an Indexer closes their allocation and wants to claim their accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph, they must provide a valid and recent POI. Fishermen may dispute the POI provided by an Indexer. A dispute resolved in the Fisherman's favor will result in slashing of the Indexer.

- **Graph Node**: Graph Node is the component that indexes subgraphs and makes the resulting data available to query via a GraphQL API. As such it is central to the Indexer stack, and correct operation of Graph Node is crucial to running a successful Indexer.

- **Indexer agent**: The Indexer agent is part of the Indexer stack. It facilitates the Indexer's interactions on-chain, including registering on the network, managing subgraph deployments to its Graph Node(s), and managing allocations.

- **The Graph Klient**: Ett bibliotek för att bygga decentraliserade dappar baserade på GraphQL.

- **Graf Explorer**: En dapp utformad för nätverksdeltagare att utforska subgrafer och interagera med protokollet.

- **Graf CLI**: Ett kommandoradsgränssnitt för att bygga och distribuera till The Graph.

- **Cooldown-period**: Den återstående tiden tills en Indexer som ändrade sina delegationsparametrar kan göra det igen.

- **L2 Transfer Tools**: Smart contracts and UI that enable network participants to transfer network related assets from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum One. Network participants can transfer delegated GRT, subgraphs, curation shares, and Indexer's self-stake.

- **Updating a subgraph**: The process of releasing a new subgraph version with updates to the subgraph's manifest, schema, or mappings.

- **Migrating**: The process of curation shares moving from an old version of a subgraph to a new version of a subgraph (e.g. when v0.0.1 is updated to v0.0.2).
