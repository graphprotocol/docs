title: Delegating
---

Delegators are network participants who delegate (i.e., "stake") GRT to one or more Indexers. Delegators help secure the network without running a Graph Node themselves.

Delegators earn a portion of an Indexer's query fees and rewards by delegating to them. The amount of queries an Indexer can process depends on their own stake, the delegated stake, and the price the Indexer charges for each query. Therefore, the more stake that is allocated to an Indexer, the more potential queries they can process.

## Delegator Guide

This guide will explain how to be an effective Delegator in the Graph Network. Delegators share the earnings of the protocol alongside all Indexers based on their delegated stake. A Delegator must use their best judgment to choose Indexers based on multiple factors. Please note this guide will not cover steps such as setting up Metamask properly, as that information is widely available on the internet.

There are three sections in this guide:

- The risks of delegating tokens in The Graph Network
- How to calculate expected returns as a Delegator
- A video guide showing the steps to delegate in the Graph Network UI

## Delegation Risks

Listed below are the main risks of being a Delegator in the protocol.

### The delegation tax

वाईट वर्तनासाठी प्रतिनिधींना कमी केले जाऊ शकत नाही, परंतु नेटवर्कच्या अखंडतेला हानी पोहोचवणाऱ्या खराब निर्णयक्षमतेला प्रोत्साहन देण्यासाठी प्रतिनिधींवर कर लावला जातो.

It is important to understand that every time you delegate, you will be charged 0.5%. This means that if you are delegating 1000 GRT, you will automatically burn 5 GRT.

In order to be safe, a Delegator should calculate their potential return when delegating to an Indexer. For example, a Delegator might calculate how many days it will take before they have earned back the 0.5% tax on their delegation.

### The delegation unbonding period

Whenever a Delegator wants to undelegate, their tokens are subject to a 28-day unbonding period. This means they cannot transfer their tokens or earn any rewards for 28 days.

Another thing to consider is how to choose an Indexer wisely. If you choose an Indexer that is not trustworthy or not doing a good job, you will want to undelegate. This means you will be losing a lot of opportunities to earn rewards, which can be just as bad as burning GRT.

### Choosing a trustworthy Indexer with a fair reward payout for Delegators

This is an important aspect to understand. First, let's discuss three very important values, which are the Delegation Parameters.

Indexing Reward Cut - The indexing reward cut is the portion of the rewards that the Indexer will keep for themselves. This means that if an Indexer's rewards are set to 100%, as a Delegator you will get 0 indexing rewards. If you see it set at 80% in the UI, that means as a Delegator, you will receive 20%. An important note - at the beginning of the network, Indexing Rewards will account for the majority of the rewards.

   मधला प्रतिनिधी 20% देत आहे. सर्वात खालचा भाग प्रतिनिधींना ~83% देत आहे.*
</div>

- Query Fee Cut - This works exactly like the Indexing Reward Cut. However, this applies explicitly to returns on the query fees the Indexer collects. It should be noted that at the start of the network, returns from query fees will be very small compared to the indexing reward. It is recommended that you pay attention to the network to determine when the query fees in the network will start to be more significant.

As you can see, in order to choose the right Indexer, you must consider multiple things. This is why we highly recommend exploring [The Graph Discord](https://discord.gg/graphprotocol) to determine which Indexers have the best social and technical reputations and which reward Delegators consistently. Many of the Indexers are very active in Discord and will be happy to answer your questions. Many of them have been Indexing for months on the testnet, and they are doing their best to help Delegators earn a good return, as it improves the health and success of the network.

### Calculating Delegators expected return

A Delegator must consider a lot of factors when determining the return. These include:

- तांत्रिक प्रतिनिधी त्यांच्याकडे उपलब्ध असलेले प्रतिनिधी टोकन वापरण्याची इंडेक्सरची क्षमता देखील पाहू शकतो. जर इंडेक्सर उपलब्ध असलेल्या सर्व टोकन्सचे वाटप करत नसेल, तर ते स्वतःसाठी किंवा त्यांच्या प्रतिनिधींसाठी जास्तीत जास्त नफा मिळवत नाहीत.
- Right now, in the network an Indexer can choose to close an allocation and collect rewards anytime between 1 and 28 days. So, it is possible that an Indexer might have a lot of rewards they still need to collect, and thus, their total rewards are low. This should be taken into consideration in the early days.

### Considering the query fee cut and indexing fee cut

वरील विभागांमध्ये वर्णन केल्याप्रमाणे, तुम्ही एक इंडेक्सर निवडला पाहिजे जो त्यांच्या क्वेरी फी कट आणि इंडेक्सिंग फी कट सेट करण्याबद्दल पारदर्शक आणि प्रामाणिक असेल. त्यांच्याकडे किती वेळ बफर आहे हे पाहण्यासाठी प्रतिनिधीने पॅरामीटर्स कूलडाउन टाइम देखील पहावे. ते पूर्ण झाल्यानंतर, प्रतिनिधींना किती बक्षिसे मिळत आहेत याची गणना करणे अगदी सोपे आहे. सूत्र आहे:

![Delegation Image 3](/img/Delegation-Reward-Formula.png)

### Considering the Indexer's delegation pool

प्रतिनिधीने विचारात घेण्याची आणखी एक गोष्ट म्हणजे त्यांच्या मालकीचे प्रतिनिधी पूल किती आहे. डेलिगेटरने पूलमध्ये जमा केलेल्या रकमेद्वारे निर्धारित पूलच्या साध्या पुनर्संतुलनासह, सर्व प्रतिनिधी पुरस्कार समान रीतीने सामायिक केले जातात. हे डेलिगेटरला पूलचा वाटा देते:

![Share formula](/img/Share-Forumla.png)

Using this formula, we can see that it is possible for an Indexer offering only 20% to Delegators to actually provide a better reward than an Indexer giving 90%.

Therefore, a Delegator can do the math to determine that the Indexer offering 20% to Delegators is offering a better return.

### Considering the delegation capacity

विचारात घेण्यासारखी दुसरी गोष्ट म्हणजे प्रतिनिधींची क्षमता. सध्या, डेलिगेशन रेशो 16 वर सेट केले आहे. याचा अर्थ असा की जर एखाद्या इंडेक्सरने 1,000,000 GRT स्टेक केले असेल, तर त्यांची डेलिगेशन क्षमता 16,000,000 GRT डेलिगेटेड टोकन्स आहे जी ते प्रोटोकॉलमध्ये वापरू शकतात. या रकमेवरील कोणतेही डेलिगेट केलेले टोकन सर्व डेलिगेटर रिवॉर्ड्स कमी करतील.

Imagine an Indexer with 100,000,000 GRT delegated to them, but their capacity is only 16,000,000 GRT. This means effectively, 84,000,000 GRT tokens are not being used to earn tokens. So, all the Delegators and the Indexer, are earning way less rewards than they could be.

Therefore, a Delegator should always consider the Delegation Capacity of an Indexer, and factor it into their decision making.

## Delegator FAQs and Bugs

### MetaMask "Pending Transaction" Bug

**When I try to delegate my transaction in MetaMask, it appears as "Pending" or "Queued" for longer than expected. What should I do?**

At times, attempts to delegate to indexers via MetaMask can fail and result in prolonged periods of "Pending" or "Queued" transaction attempts.

For example, a user may attempt to delegate with an insufficient gas fee relative to the current prices, resulting in the transaction attempt displaying as "Pending" in their MetaMask wallet for 15+ minutes. When this occurs, a user can attempt subsequent transactions, but these will only be processed until the initial transaction is mined, as transactions for an address must be processed in order. In such cases, these transactions can be cancelled in MetaMask, but the transactions attempts will accrue gas fees without any guarantee that subsequent attempts will be successful.

A simpler resolution to this bug is restarting the browser (e.g., using "abort:restart" in the address bar), which will cancel all previous attempts without gas being subtracted from the wallet. Several users who have encountered this issue have reported successful transactions after restarting their browser and attempting to delegate.
