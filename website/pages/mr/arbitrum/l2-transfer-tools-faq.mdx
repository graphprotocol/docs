title: L2 हस्तांतरण साधने FAQ
---

> L2 ट्रान्सफर टूल्स अजून रिलीझ झालेले नाहीत. ते 2023 च्या उन्हाळ्यात उपलब्ध होतील अशी अपेक्षा आहे.

## L2 हस्तांतरण साधने काय आहेत?

Arbitrum One वर प्रोटोकॉल लागू करून योगदानकर्त्यांना नेटवर्कमध्ये सहभागी होण्यासाठी ग्राफने 26x स्वस्त केले आहे. L2 कडे जाणे सोपे करण्यासाठी L2 हस्तांतरण साधने कोर devs द्वारे तयार केली गेली. प्रत्येक प्रोटोकॉल सहभागीसाठी, L2 वर जाताना, वितळण्याचा कालावधी टाळून किंवा मॅन्युअली माघार घेणे आणि GRT ब्रिज करणे टाळून अनुभव अखंडित करण्यासाठी हस्तांतरण सहाय्यकांचा संच सामायिक केला जाईल. तुमची भूमिका The Graph मध्ये काय आहे आणि तुम्ही L2 मध्ये काय हस्तांतरित करत आहात यावर अवलंबून या साधनांसाठी तुम्हाला चरणांच्या विशिष्ट संचाचे अनुसरण करणे आवश्यक आहे.

## मी इथरियम मेननेटवर वापरतो तेच वॉलेट मी वापरू शकतो का?

तुम्ही [EOA](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) वॉलेट वापरत असल्यास तुम्ही तोच पत्ता वापरू शकता. जर तुमचे इथरियम मेननेट वॉलेट करार असेल (उदा. मल्टीसिग) तर तुम्ही [आर्बिट्रम वॉलेट पत्ता]\(/arbitrum/arbitrum-faq/#what-do-i-need-to-do-to-use-the- निर्दिष्ट करणे आवश्यक आहे. graph-on-l2) जिथे तुमचे हस्तांतरण पाठवले जाईल. कृपया पत्ता काळजीपूर्वक तपासा कारण चुकीच्या पत्त्यावर कोणतेही हस्तांतरण कायमचे नुकसान होऊ शकते. तुम्हाला L2 वर मल्टीसिग वापरायचे असल्यास, तुम्ही आर्बिट्रम वन वर मल्टीसिग कॉन्ट्रॅक्ट तैनात केल्याची खात्री करा.

## सबग्राफ हस्तांतरण

## मी माझा सबग्राफ कसा हस्तांतरित करू?

तुमचा सबग्राफ हस्तांतरित करण्यासाठी, तुम्हाला खालील चरण पूर्ण करावे लागतील:

1.  Ethereum mainnet वर हस्तांतरण सुरू करा

2.  पुष्टीकरणासाठी 20 मिनिटे प्रतीक्षा करा

3.  आर्बिट्रमवर सबग्राफ हस्तांतरणाची पुष्टी करा\*

4.  आर्बिट्रमवर प्रकाशन सबग्राफ समाप्त करा

5.  क्वेरी URL अपडेट करा (शिफारस केलेले)

\*Note that you must confirm the transfer within 7 days otherwise your subgraph may be lost. In most cases, this step will run automatically, but a manual confirmation may be needed if there is a gas price spike on Arbitrum. If there are any issues during this process, there will be resources to help: contact support at support@thegraph.com or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP).

## मी माझे हस्तांतरण कोठून सुरू करावे?

You can initiate your transfer from the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/), [Explorer,](https://thegraph.com/explorer) or any subgraph details page. Click the "Transfer Subgraph" button in the subgraph details page to start the transfer.

## माझा सबग्राफ हस्तांतरित होईपर्यंत मला किती वेळ प्रतीक्षा करावी लागेल

The transfer time takes approximately 20 minutes. The Arbitrum bridge is working in the background to complete the bridge transfer automatically. In some cases, gas costs may spike and you will need to confirm the transaction again.

## मी L2 मध्ये हस्तांतरित केल्यानंतर माझा सबग्राफ अजूनही शोधण्यायोग्य असेल का?

Your subgraph will only be discoverable on the network it is published to. For example, if your subgraph is on Arbitrum One, then you can only find it in Explorer on Arbitrum One and will not be able to find it on Ethereum. Please ensure that you have Arbitrum One selected in the network switcher at the top of the page to ensure you are on the correct network.  After the transfer, the L1 subgraph will appear as deprecated.

## माझा सबग्राफ हस्तांतरित करण्यासाठी प्रकाशित करणे आवश्यक आहे का?

To take advantage of the subgraph transfer tool, your subgraph must be already published to Ethereum mainnet and must have some curation signal owned by the wallet that owns the subgraph. If your subgraph is not published, it is recommended you simply publish directly on Arbitrum One - the associated gas fees will be considerably lower. If you want to transfer a published subgraph but the owner account hasn't curated any signal on it, you can signal a small amount (e.g. 1 GRT) from that account; make sure to choose "auto-migrating" signal.

## What happens to the Ethereum mainnet version of my subgraph after I transfer to Arbitrum?

After transferring your subgraph to Arbitrum, the Ethereum mainnet version will be deprecated. We recommend you update your query URL within 48 hours. However, there is a grace period in place that keeps your mainnet URL functioning so that any third-party dapp support can be updated.

## मी हस्तांतरित केल्यानंतर, मला आर्बिट्रमवर पुन्हा प्रकाशित करण्याची देखील आवश्यकता आहे का?

After the 20 minute transfer window, you will need to confirm the transfer with a transaction in the UI to finish the transfer, but the transfer tool will guide you through this. Your L1 endpoint will continue to be supported during the transfer window and a grace period after. It is encouraged that you update your endpoint when convenient for you.

## Will there be down-time on my endpoint while republishing?

There should be no down time when using the transfer tool to move your subgraph to L2.Your L1 endpoint will continue to be supported during the transfer window and a grace period after. It is encouraged that you update your endpoint when convenient for you.

## प्रकाशन आणि आवृत्ती L2 वर Ethereum Ethereum mainnet प्रमाणेच आहे का?

Yes. Be sure to select Arbitrum One as your published network when publishing in Subgraph Studio. In the Studio, the latest endpoint will be available which points to the latest updated version of the subgraph.

## माझ्या सबग्राफचे क्युरेशन माझ्या सबग्राफसह हलवेल का?

If you've chosen auto-migrating signal, 100% of your own curation will move with your subgraph to Arbitrum One. All of the subgraph's curation signal will be converted to GRT at the time of the transfer, and the GRT corresponding to your curation signal will be used to mint signal on the L2 subgraph.

इतर क्युरेटर निवडू शकतात की त्यांचा GRT चा अंश काढून घ्यायचा किंवा त्याच सबग्राफवरील मिंट सिग्नलला L2 मध्ये हस्तांतरित करा.

## मी हस्तांतरित केल्यानंतर मी माझा सबग्राफ परत इथरियम मेननेटवर हलवू शकतो का?

Once transferred, your Ethereum mainnet version of this subgraph will be deprecated. If you would like to move back to mainnet, you will need to redeploy and publish back to mainnet. However, transferring back to Ethereum mainnet is strongly discouraged as indexing rewards will eventually be distributed entirely on Arbitrum One.

## माझे हस्तांतरण पूर्ण करण्यासाठी मला ब्रिज्ड ETH का आवश्यक आहे?

Gas fees on Arbitrum One are paid using bridged ETH (i.e. ETH that has been bridged to Arbitrum One). However, the gas fees are significantly lower when compared to Ethereum mainnet.

## क्युरेशन सिग्नल

## मी माझे क्युरेशन कसे हस्तांतरित करू?

तुमचे क्युरेशन हस्तांतरित करण्यासाठी, तुम्हाला खालील चरण पूर्ण करावे लागतील:

1.  इथरियम मेननेटवर सिग्नल ट्रान्सफर सुरू करा

2.  L2 क्युरेटर पत्ता निर्दिष्ट करा\*

3.  पुष्टीकरणासाठी 20 मिनिटे प्रतीक्षा करा

\*आवश्यक असल्यास - म्हणजे तुम्ही कराराचा पत्ता वापरत आहात.

## मी क्युरेट केलेला सबग्राफ L2 वर गेला असल्यास मला कसे कळेल?

When viewing the subgraph details page, a banner will notify you that this subgraph has been transferred. You can follow the prompt to transfer your curation. You can also find this information on the subgraph details page of any subgraph that has moved.

## मी माझे क्युरेशन L2 वर हलवू इच्छित नसल्यास काय करावे?

जेव्हा सबग्राफ नापसंत केला जातो तेव्हा तुम्हाला तुमचा सिग्नल मागे घेण्याचा पर्याय असतो. त्याचप्रमाणे, जर सबग्राफ L2 वर गेला असेल, तर तुम्ही Ethereum mainnet मध्ये तुमचे सिग्नल मागे घेणे किंवा L2 ला सिग्नल पाठवणे निवडू शकता.

## माझे क्युरेशन यशस्वीरित्या हस्तांतरित झाले हे मला कसे कळेल?

L2 ट्रान्सफर टूल सुरू झाल्यानंतर अंदाजे 20 मिनिटांनंतर सिग्नल तपशील एक्सप्लोररद्वारे प्रवेशयोग्य असतील.

## मी माझे क्युरेशन एका वेळी एकापेक्षा जास्त सबग्राफवर हस्तांतरित करू शकतो का?

यावेळी मोठ्या प्रमाणात हस्तांतरण पर्याय नाही.

## इंडेक्सर स्टेक

## मी माझे स्टेक आर्बिट्रमला कसे हस्तांतरित करू?

To transfer your stake, you will need to complete the following steps:

1.  इथरियम मेननेटवर स्टेक ट्रान्सफर सुरू करा

2.  पुष्टीकरणासाठी 20 मिनिटे प्रतीक्षा करा

3.  आर्बिट्रमवर हस्तांतरण स्थितीची पुष्टी करा

\*Note that you must confirm the transfer within 7 days otherwise your stake may be lost. In most cases, this step will run automatically, but a manual confirmation may be needed if there is a gas price spike on Arbitrum. If there are any issues during this process, there will be resources to help: contact support at support@thegraph.com or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP).

## माझे सर्व स्टेक ट्रान्सफर होतील का?

You can choose how much of your stake to transfer. If you choose to transfer all of your stake at once, you will need to close any open allocations first.

If you plan on transferring parts of your stake over multiple transactions, you must always specify the same beneficiary address.

Note: You must meet the minimum stake requirements on L2 the first time you use the transfer tool. Indexers must send the minimum 100k GRT (when calling this function the first time). If leaving a portion of stake on L1, it must also be over the 100k GRT minimum and be sufficient (together with your delegations) to cover your open allocations.

## How much time do I have to confirm my stake transfer to Arbitrum?

\*\*\* You must confirm your transaction to complete the stake transfer on Arbitrum. This step must be completed within 7 days or stake could be lost.

## माझ्याकडे खुले वाटप असल्यास काय?

If you are not sending all of your stake, the L2 transfer tool will validate that at least the minimum 100k GRT remains in Ethereum mainnet and your remaining stake and delegation is enough to cover any open allocations. You may need to close open allocations if your GRT balance does not cover the minimums + open allocations.

## Using the transfer tools, is it necessary to wait 28 days to unstake on Ethereum mainnet before transferring?

No, you can transfer your stake to L2 immediately, there's no need to unstake and wait before using the transfer tool. The 28-day wait only applies if you'd like to withdraw the stake back to your wallet, on Ethereum mainnet or L2.

## माझा हिस्सा हस्तांतरित करण्यासाठी किती वेळ लागेल?

It will take approximately 20 minutes for the L2 transfer tool to complete transferring your stake.

## Do I have to index on Arbitrum before I transfer my stake?

You can effectively transfer your stake first before setting up indexing, but you will not be able to claim any rewards on L2 until you allocate to subgraphs on L2, index them, and present POIs.

## Can Delegators move their delegation before I move my indexing stake?

No, in order for Delegators to transfer their delegated GRT to Arbitrum, the Indexer they are delegating to must be active on L2.

## Can I transfer my stake if I'm using a GRT vesting contract / token lock wallet?

Yes! The process is a bit different, because vesting contracts can't forward the ETH needed to pay for the L2 gas, so you need to deposit it beforehand. If your vesting contract is not fully vested, you will also have to first initialize a counterpart vesting contract on L2 and will only be able to transfer the stake to this L2 vesting contract. The UI on Explorer can guide you through this process when you've connected to Explorer using the vesting lock wallet.

## Delegation

## How do I transfer my delegation?

To transfer your delegation, you will need to complete the following steps:

1.  Initiate delegation transfer on Ethereum mainnet

2.  पुष्टीकरणासाठी 20 मिनिटे प्रतीक्षा करा

3.  Confirm delegation transfer on Arbitrum

\*\*\*\*You must confirm the transaction to complete the delegation transfer on Arbitrum. This step must be completed within 7 days or the delegation could be lost. In most cases, this step will run automatically, but a manual confirmation may be needed if there is a gas price spike on Arbitrum. If there are any issues during this process, there will be resources to help: contact support at support@thegraph.com or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP).

## What happens to my rewards if I initiate a transfer with an open allocation on Ethereum mainnet?

If the indexer to whom you're delegating is still operating on L1, when you transfer to Arbitrum you will forfeit any delegation rewards from open allocations on Ethereum mainnet. This means that you will lose the rewards from, at most, the last 28-day period. If you time the transfer right after the indexer has closed allocations you can make sure this is the least amount possible. If you have a communication channel with your indexer(s), consider discussing with them to find the best time to do your transfer.

## What happens if the Indexer I currently delegate to isn't on Arbitrum One?

The L2 transfer tool will only be enabled if the Indexer you have delegated to has transferred their own stake to Arbitrum.

## Do Delegators have the option to delegate to another Indexer?

If you wish to delegate to another Indexer, you can transfer to the same indexer on Arbitrum, then undelegate and wait for the thawing period. After this, you can select another active Indexer to delegate to.

## What if I can't find the Indexer I'm delegating to on L2?

The L2 transfer tool will automatically detect the Indexer you previously delegated to.

## Will I be able to mix and match or 'spread' my delegation across new or several Indexers instead of the prior Indexer?

The L2 transfer tool will always move your delegation to the same Indexer you delegated to previously. Once you have moved to L2, you can undelegate, wait for the thawing period, and decide if you'd like to split up your delegation.

## Am I subject to the cooldown period or can I withdraw immediately after using the L2 delegation transfer tool?

The transfer tool allows you to immediately move to L2. If you would like to undelegate you will have to wait for the thawing period. However, if an Indexer has transferred all of their stake to L2, you can withdraw on Ethereum mainnet immediately.

## Can my rewards be negatively impacted if I do not transfer my delegation?

It is anticipated that all network participation will move to Arbitrum One in the future.

## How long does it take to complete the transfer of my delegation to L2?

A 20-minute confirmation is required for delegation transfer. Please note that after the 20-minute period, you must come back and complete step 3 of the transfer process within 7 days. If you fail to do this, then your delegation may be lost. Note that in most cases the transfer tool will complete this step for you automatically. In case of a failed auto-attempt, you will need to complete it manually. If any issues arise during this process, don't worry, we'll be here to help: contact us at (support email address) or on the (channel) channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP).

## Can I transfer my delegation if I'm using a GRT vesting contract/token lock wallet?

Yes! The process is a bit different because vesting contracts can't forward the ETH needed to pay for the L2 gas, so you need to deposit it beforehand. If your vesting contract is not fully vested, you will also have to first initialize a counterpart vesting contract on L2 and will only be able to transfer the delegation to this L2 vesting contract. The UI on Explorer can guide you through this process when you've connected to Explorer using the vesting lock wallet.

## Is there any delegation tax?

No. Received tokens on L2 are delegated to the specified Indexer on behalf of the specified Delegator without charging a delegation tax.

## Vesting Contract Transfer

## How do I transfer my vesting contract?

To transfer your vesting, you will need to complete the following steps:

1.  Initiate the vesting transfer on Ethereum mainnet

2.  पुष्टीकरणासाठी 20 मिनिटे प्रतीक्षा करा

3.  Confirm vesting transfer on Arbitrum

## How do I transfer my vesting contract if I am only partially vested?

1.  Deposit some ETH into the transfer tool contract (UI can help estimate a reasonable amount)

2.  Send some locked GRT through the transfer tool contract, to L2 to initialize the L2 vesting lock. This will also set their L2 beneficiary address.

3.  Send their stake/delegation to L2 through the "locked" transfer tool functions in the L1Staking contract.

4.  Withdraw any remaining ETH from the transfer tool contract

## How do I transfer my vesting contract if I am fully vested?

For those that are fully vested, the process is similar:

1.  Deposit some ETH into the transfer tool contract (UI can help estimate a reasonable amount)

2.  Set your L2 address with a call to the transfer tool contract

3.  Send your stake/delegation to L2 through the "locked" transfer tool functions in the L1 Staking contract.

4.  Withdraw any remaining ETH from the transfer tool contract

## Can I transfer my vesting contract to Arbitrum?

You can transfer your vesting contract's GRT balance to a vesting contract in L2. This is a prerequisite for transferring stake or delegation from your vesting contract to L2. The vesting contract must hold a nonzero amount of GRT (you can transfer a small amount like 1 GRT to it if needed).

When you transfer GRT from your L1 vesting contract to L2, you can choose the amount to send and you can do this as many times as you like. The L2 vesting contract will be initialized the first time you transfer GRT.

The transfers are done using a Transfer Tool that will be visible on your Explorer profile when you connect with the vesting contract account.

Please note that you will not be able to release/withdraw GRT from the L2 vesting contract until the end of your vesting timeline when your contract is fully vested. If you need to release GRT before then, you can transfer the GRT back to the L1 vesting contract using another transfer tool that is available for that purpose.

If you haven't transferred any vesting contract balance to L2, and your vesting contract is fully vested, you should not transfer your vesting contract to L2. Instead, you can use the transfer tools to set an L2 wallet address, and directly transfer your stake or delegation to this regular wallet on L2.

## I'm using my vesting contract to stake on mainnet. Can I transfer my stake to Arbitrum?

Yes, but if your contract is still vesting, you can only transfer the stake so that it is owned by your L2 vesting contract. You must first initialize this L2 contract by transferring some GRT balance using the vesting contract transfer tool on Explorer. If your contract is fully vested, you can transfer your stake to any address in L2, but you must set it beforehand and deposit some ETH for the L2 transfer tool to pay for L2 gas.

## I'm using my vesting contract to delegate on mainnet. Can I transfer my delegations to Arbitrum?

Yes, but if your contract is still vesting, you can only transfer the delegation so that it is owned by your L2 vesting contract. You must first initialize this L2 contract by transferring some GRT balance using the vesting contract transfer tool on Explorer. If your contract is fully vested, you can transfer your delegation to any address in L2, but you must set it beforehand and deposit some ETH for the L2 transfer tool to pay for L2 gas.

## Can I specify a different beneficiary for my vesting contract on L2?

Yes, the first time you transfer a balance and set up your L2 vesting contract, you can specify an L2 beneficiary. Make sure this beneficiary is a wallet that can perform transactions on Arbitrum One, i.e. it must be an EOA or a multisig deployed to Arbitrum One.

If your contract is fully vested, you will not set up a vesting contract on L2; instead, you will set an L2 wallet address and this will be the receiving wallet for your stake or delegation on Arbitrum.

## My contract is fully vested. Can I transfer my stake or delegation to another address that is not an L2 vesting contract?

Yes. If you haven't transferred any vesting contract balance to L2, and your vesting contract is fully vested, you should not transfer your vesting contract to L2. Instead, you can use the transfer tools to set an L2 wallet address, and directly transfer your stake or delegation to this regular wallet on L2.

This allows you to transfer your stake or delegation to any L2 address.

## My vesting contract is still vesting. How do I transfer my vesting contract balance to L2?

These steps only apply if your contract is still vesting, or if you've used this process before when your contract was still vesting.

To transfer your vesting contract to L2, you will send any GRT balance to L2 using the transfer tools, which will initialize your L2 vesting contract:

1.  Deposit some ETH into the transfer tool contract (this will be used to pay for L2 gas)

2.  Revoke protocol access to the vesting contract (needed for the next step)

3.  Give protocol access to the vesting contract (will allow your contract to interact with the transfer tool)

4.  Specify an L2 beneficiary address\* and initiate the balance transfer on Ethereum mainnet

5.  पुष्टीकरणासाठी 20 मिनिटे प्रतीक्षा करा

6.  Confirm the balance transfer on L2

\*आवश्यक असल्यास - म्हणजे तुम्ही कराराचा पत्ता वापरत आहात.

\*\*\*\*You must confirm your transaction to complete the balance transfer on Arbitrum. This step must be completed within 7 days or the balance could be lost. In most cases, this step will run automatically, but a manual confirmation may be needed if there is a gas price spike on Arbitrum. If there are any issues during this process, there will be resources to help: contact support at support@thegraph.com or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP).

## Can I move my vesting contract back to L1?

There is no need to do so because your vesting contract is still in L1. When you use the transfer tools, you just create a new contract in L2 that is connected with your L1 vesting contract, and you can send GRT back and forth between the two.

## Why do I need to move my vesting contract to begin with?

You need to set up an L2 vesting contract so that this account can own your stake or delegation on L2. Otherwise, there'd be no way for you to transfer the stake/delegation to L2 without "escaping" the vesting contract.

## What happens if I try to cash out my contract when it is only partially vested? Is this possible?

This is not a possibility. You can move funds back to L1 and withdraw them there.

## मला माझा वेस्टिंग कॉन्ट्रॅक्ट L2 वर हलवायचा नसेल तर?

You can keep staking/delegating on L1. Over time, you may want to consider moving to L2 to enable rewards there as the protocol scales on Arbitrum. Note that these transfer tools are for vesting contracts that are allowed to stake and delegate in the protocol. If your contract does not allow staking or delegating, or is revocable, then there is no transfer tool available. You will still be able to withdraw your GRT from L1 when available.
