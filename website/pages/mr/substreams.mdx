![Substreams Logo](/img/substreams-logo.png)

Substreams is a powerful blockchain indexing technology developed for The Graph Network. It enables developers to write Rust modules, compose data streams alongside the community, and provide extremely high-performance indexing due to parallelization in a streaming-first approach.

With Substreams, developers can quickly extract data from different blockchains (Ethereum, BNB, Solana, ect.) and send it to various locations of their choice, such as a Postgres database, a Mongo database, or a Subgraph. Additionally, Substreams packages enable developers to specify which data they want to extract from the blockchain.

## How Substreams Works in 4 Steps

1. **You write a Rust program, which defines the transformations that you want to apply to the blockchain data.** For example, the following Rust function extracts relevant information from an Ethereum block (number, hash, and parent hash).

```rust
fn get_my_block(blk: Block) -> Result<MyBlock, substreams::errors::Error> {
    let header = blk.header.as_ref().unwrap();

    Ok(MyBlock {
        number: blk.number,
        hash: Hex::encode(&blk.hash),
        parent_hash: Hex::encode(&header.parent_hash),
    })
}
```

2. **You wrap up your Rust program into a WASM module just by running a single CLI command.**

3. **The WASM container is sent to a Substreams endpoint for execution.** The Substreams provider feeds the WASM container with the blockchain data and the transformations are applied.

4. **You select a [sink](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/consume/other-sinks), a place where you want to send the transformed data** (a Postgres database or a Subgraph, for example).

## Substreams Documentation

The official Substreams documentation is currently maintained by the StreamingFast team [on the StreamingFast website](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/).

To learn about the latest version of Substreams CLI, which enables developers to bootstrap a Substreams project without any code, please check [Substreams Codegen](https://streamingfastio.medium.com/substreams-codegen-no-code-tool-to-bootstrap-your-project-a11efe0378c6).

### प्रारंभ करणे

- In order to develop and deploy a Substreams, [you must install the Substreams CLI](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/consume/installing-the-cli).
- Then, run your first Substreams by following the [Quickstart Tutorial](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/init-project).

### Expand Your Knowledge

- Take a look at the [Ethereum Explorer Tutorial](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/tutorials/evm) to learn about the basic transformations you can create with Substreams.
