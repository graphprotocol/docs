title: Writing AssemblyScript Mappings
---

## सविश्लेषण

The mappings take data from a particular source and transform it into entities that are defined within your schema. Mappings are written in a subset of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) called [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/wiki) which can be compiled to WASM ([WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)). AssemblyScript is stricter than normal TypeScript, yet provides a familiar syntax.

For each event handler that is defined in `subgraph.yaml` under `mapping.eventHandlers`, create an exported function of the same name. Each handler must accept a single parameter called `event` with a type corresponding to the name of the event which is being handled.

In the example subgraph, `src/mapping.ts` contains handlers for the `NewGravatar` and `UpdatedGravatar` events:

```javascript
import { NewGravatar, UpdatedGravatar } from '../generated/Gravity/Gravity'
import { Gravatar } from '../generated/schema'

export function handleNewGravatar(event: NewGravatar): void {
  let gravatar = new Gravatar(event.params.id)
  gravatar.owner = event.params.owner
  gravatar.displayName = event.params.displayName
  gravatar.imageUrl = event.params.imageUrl
  gravatar.save()
}

export function handleUpdatedGravatar(event: UpdatedGravatar): void {
  let id = event.params.id
  let gravatar = Gravatar.load(id)
  if (gravatar == null) {
    gravatar = new Gravatar(id)
  }
  gravatar.owner = event.params.owner
  gravatar.displayName = event.params.displayName
  gravatar.imageUrl = event.params.imageUrl
  gravatar.save()
}
```

The first handler takes a `NewGravatar` event and creates a new `Gravatar` entity with `new Gravatar(event.params.id.toHex())`, populating the entity fields using the corresponding event parameters. This entity instance is represented by the variable `gravatar`, with an id value of `event.params.id.toHex()`.

The second handler tries to load the existing `Gravatar` from the Graph Node store. If it does not exist yet, it is created on-demand. The entity is then updated to match the new event parameters before it is saved back to the store using `gravatar.save()`.

It is highly recommended to use `Bytes` as the type for `id` fields, and only use `String` for attributes that truly contain human-readable text, like the name of a token. Below are some recommended `id` values to consider when creating new entities.

- `transfer.id = event.transaction.hash`

- `let id = event.transaction.hash.concatI32(event.logIndex.toI32())`

- For entities that store aggregated data, for e.g, daily trade volumes, the `id` usually contains the day number. Here, using a `Bytes` as the `id` is beneficial. Determining the `id` would look like

```typescript
let dayID = event.block.timestamp.toI32() / 86400
let id = Bytes.fromI32(dayID)
```

- Convert constant addresses to `Bytes`.

`const id = Bytes.fromHexString('0xdead...beef')`

There is a [Graph Typescript Library](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-tooling/tree/main/packages/ts) which contains utilities for interacting with the Graph Node store and conveniences for handling smart contract data and entities. It can be imported into `mapping.ts` from `@graphprotocol/graph-ts`.

### Handling of entities with identical IDs

When creating and saving a new entity, if an entity with the same ID already exists, the properties of the new entity are always preferred during the merge process. This means that the existing entity will be updated with the values from the new entity.

If a null value is intentionally set for a field in the new entity with the same ID, the existing entity will be updated with the null value.

If no value is set for a field in the new entity with the same ID, the field will result in null as well.

## कोड जनरेशन

स्मार्ट कॉन्ट्रॅक्ट्स, इव्हेंट्स आणि संस्थांसोबत काम करणे सोपे आणि टाइप-सुरक्षित करण्यासाठी, ग्राफ CLI सबग्राफच्या GraphQL स्कीमा आणि डेटा स्रोतांमध्ये समाविष्ट केलेल्या कॉन्ट्रॅक्ट ABIs मधून असेंबलीस्क्रिप्ट प्रकार व्युत्पन्न करू शकतो.

यासह केले जाते

```sh
graph codegen [--output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>] [<MANIFEST>]
```

but in most cases, subgraphs are already preconfigured via `package.json` to allow you to simply run one of the following to achieve the same:

```sh
# Yarn
yarn codegen

# NPM
npm run codegen
```

This will generate an AssemblyScript class for every smart contract in the ABI files mentioned in `subgraph.yaml`, allowing you to bind these contracts to specific addresses in the mappings and call read-only contract methods against the block being processed. It will also generate a class for every contract event to provide easy access to event parameters, as well as the block and transaction the event originated from. All of these types are written to `<OUTPUT_DIR>/<DATA_SOURCE_NAME>/<ABI_NAME>.ts`. In the example subgraph, this would be `generated/Gravity/Gravity.ts`, allowing mappings to import these types with.

```javascript
import {
  // The contract class:
  Gravity,
  // The events classes:
  NewGravatar,
  UpdatedGravatar,
} from '../generated/Gravity/Gravity'
```

In addition to this, one class is generated for each entity type in the subgraph's GraphQL schema. These classes provide type-safe entity loading, read and write access to entity fields as well as a `save()` method to write entities to store. All entity classes are written to `<OUTPUT_DIR>/schema.ts`, allowing mappings to import them with

```javascript
import { Gravatar } from '../generated/schema'
```

> **Note:** The code generation must be performed again after every change to the GraphQL schema or the ABIs included in the manifest. It must also be performed at least once before building or deploying the subgraph.

Code generation does not check your mapping code in `src/mapping.ts`. If you want to check that before trying to deploy your subgraph to Graph Explorer, you can run `yarn build` and fix any syntax errors that the TypeScript compiler might find.
