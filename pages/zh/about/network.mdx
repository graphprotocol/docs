The Graph Network is a decentralized indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. Applications use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, developers can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure. 应用程序使用GraphQL查询称为子图的开放API，以检索网络上的索引数据。 通过The Graph，开发者可以建立完全在公共基础设施上运行的无服务器应用程序。

## 概述

The Graph Network consists of Indexers, Curators and Delegators that provide services to the network, and serve data to Web3 applications. Consumers use the applications and consume the data. 消费者使用应用程序并消费数据。

为了确保The Graph 网络的经济安全和被查询数据的完整性，参与者将Graph 令牌（GRT）质押并使用。 To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants stake and use Graph Tokens (GRT). GRT is a work token that is an ERC-20 on the Ethereum blockchain, used to allocate resources in the network. Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can provide services and earn income from the network, proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake. 活跃的索引人、策展人和委托人可以提供服务，并从网络中获得收入，与他们的工作量和他们的GRT委托量成正比。
