Curators are critical to the Graph decentralized economy. They use their knowledge of the web3 ecosystem to assess and signal on the subgraphs that should be indexed by The Graph Network. Through the Explorer, curators are able to view network data to make signaling decisions. The Graph Network rewards curators that signal on good quality subgraphs earn a share of the query fees that subgraphs generate. Curators are economically incentivized to signal early. These cues from curators are important for Indexers, who can then process or index the data from these signaled subgraphs.

在发出信号时，策展人可以决定在子图的一个特定版本上发出信号，或者使用自动迁移发出信号。 当使用自动迁移发出信号时，策展人的份额将始终升级到由开发商发布的最新版本。 如果你决定在一个特定的版本上发出信号，股份将始终保持在这个特定的版本上。

Remember that curation is risky. 请做好你的工作，确保你在你信任的子图上进行策展。 请做好你的工作，确保你在你信任的子图上进行策展。 创建子图是没有权限的，所以人们可以创建子图，并称其为任何他们想要的名字。 关于策展风险的更多指导，请查看 [The Graph Academy 的策展指南。](https://thegraph.academy/curators/)

## 联合曲线 101

First, we take a step back. Each subgraph has a bonding curve on which curation shares are minted when a user adds signal **into** the curve. Each subgraph’s bonding curve is unique. The bonding curves are architected so that the price to mint a curation share on a subgraph increases linearly, over the number of shares minted.

因此，价格是线性增长的，这意味着随着时间的推移，购买股票的成本会越来越高。 这里有一个例子说明我们的意思，请看下面的粘合曲线。

考虑到我们有两个策展人，他们为一个子图铸造了股份：

- 策展人 A 是第一个对子图发出信号的人。 通过在曲线中加入 120,000 GRT，他们能够铸造出 2000 股。
- 策展人 B 在之后的某个时间点在子图上发出信号。 为了获得与策展人 A 相同数量的股票，他们必须在曲线中加入 360,000 GRT。
- 由于两位策展人都持有策展人股份总数的一半，他们将获得同等数量的策展人使用费。
- 如果任何一个策展人现在烧掉他们的 2000 个策展份额，他们将获得 360,000 GRT。
- 剩下的策展人现在将收到该子图的所有策展人使用费。 如果他们烧掉他们的股份来提取 GRT，他们将得到 12 万 GRT。
- **TLDR:** The GRT valuation of curation shares is determined by the bonding curve and can be volatile. There is potential to incur big losses. Signaling early means you put in less GRT for each share. By extension, this means you earn more curator royalties per GRT than later curators for the same subgraph.

一般来说，粘合曲线是一条数学曲线，定义了代币供应和资产价格之间的关系。 在子图策展的具体情况下，\*\*资产（子图份额）的价格随着每一个代币的投入而增加，资产的价格随着每一个代币的出售而减少。

在 The Graph 的案例中， [Bancor 对粘合曲线公式的实施](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3HPNP-GDn7aRkVaV3dkVl9NS2M/view?resourcekey=0-mbIgrdd0B9H8dPNRaeB_TA) 被利用。

## 如何进行信号处理

Now that we’ve covered the basics about how the bonding curve works, this is how you will proceed to signal on a subgraph. Within the Curator tab on the Graph Explorer, curators will be able to signal and unsignal on certain subgraphs based on network stats. For a step-by-step overview of how to do this in the Explorer, [click here.](/explorer)

策展人可以选择在特定的子图版本上发出信号，或者他们可以选择让他们的策展份额自动迁移到该子图的最新生产版本。 这两种策略都是有效的，都有各自的优点和缺点。

Signaling on a specific version is especially useful when one subgraph is used by multiple dApps. One dApp might need to regularly update the subgraph with new features. Another dApp might prefer to use an older, well-tested subgraph version. Upon initial curation, a 1% standard tax is incurred.

Having your signal automatically migrate to the newest production build can be valuable to ensure you keep accruing query fees. Every time you curate, a 1% curation tax is incurred. You will also pay a 0.5% curation tax on every migration. Subgraph developers are discouraged from frequently publishing new versions - they have to pay a 0.5% curation tax on all auto-migrated curation shares.

> **注意**: 第一个给特定子图发出信号的地址被认为是第一个策展人，将不得不消耗比之后其他策展人更多的燃料工作，因为第一个策展人初始化了策展份额代币，初始化了粘合曲线，还将代币转移到 Graph 代理。

## 信号对 The Graph 网络意味着什么？

为了让终端消费者能够查询一个子图，该子图必须首先被索引。 索引是一个过程，对文件、数据和元数据进行查看、编目，然后编制索引，这样可以更快地找到结果。 为了使子图的数据可以被搜索到，它需要被组织起来。

因此，如果索引人不得不猜测他们应该索引哪些子图，那么他们赚取强大的查询费用的机会就会很低，因为他们没有办法验证哪些子图是高质量的。 进入策展阶段。

Curators make The Graph network efficient and signaling is the process that curators use to let Indexers know that a subgraph is good to index, where GRT is added to a bonding curve for a subgraph. Indexers can inherently trust the signal from a curator because upon signaling, curators mint a curation share for the subgraph, entitling them to a portion of future query fees that the subgraph drives. Curator signal is represented as ERC20 tokens called Graph Curation Shares (GCS). Curators that want to earn more query fees should signal their GRT to subgraphs that they predict will generate a strong flow of fees to the network. Curators cannot be slashed for bad behavior, but there is a deposit tax on Curators to disincentivize poor decision-making that could harm the integrity of the network. Curators also earn fewer query fees if they choose to curate on a low-quality Subgraph since there will be fewer queries to process or fewer Indexers to process those queries. See the diagram below!

## 风险

1. 在 The Graph，查询市场本来就很年轻，由于市场动态刚刚开始，你的年收益率可能低于你的预期，这是有风险的。
2. 策展费 - 当策展人对子图发出 GRT 信号时，他们会产生 1%的策展税。 这笔费用被烧掉，剩下的被存入绑定曲线的储备供应中。
3. When curators burn their shares to withdraw GRT, the GRT valuation of the remaining shares will be reduced. Be aware that in some cases, curators may decide to burn their shares **all at once**. This situation may be common if a dApp developer stops versioning/improving and querying their subgraph or if a subgraph fails. As a result, remaining curators might only be able to withdraw a fraction of their initial GRT. For a network role with a lower risk profile, see [Delegators](/delegating).
4. 一个子图可能由于错误而失败。 一个失败的子图不会累积查询费用。 因此，你必须等待，直到开发人员修复错误并部署一个新的版本。
   - 如果你订阅了一个子图的最新版本，你的股份将自动迁移到该新版本。 这将产生 0.5%的策展税。
   - If you have signaled on a specific subgraph version and it fails, you will have to manually burn your curation shares. Note that you may receive more or less GRT than you initially deposited into the curation curve, which is a risk associated with being a curator. You can then signal on the new subgraph version, thus incurring a 1% curation tax.

## 策展常见问题

### 1. 策展人能赚取多少百分比的查询费？

By signalling on a subgraph, you will earn a share of all the query fees that this subgraph generates. 10% of all query fees goes to the Curators pro-rata to their curation shares. This 10% is subject to governance.

### 2. 我如何决定哪些子图是高质量的信号？

Finding high-quality subgraphs is a complex task, but it can be approached in many different ways. As a Curator, you want to look for trustworthy subgraphs that are driving query volume. A trustworthy subgraph may be valuable if it is complete, accurate, and supports a dApp’s data needs. A poorly architected subgraph might need to be revised or re-published, and can also end up failing. It is critical for Curators to review a subgraph’s architecture or code in order to assess if a subgraph is valuable. As a result:

- 策展人可以利用他们的市场知识，尝试预测单个子图在未来可能产生更多或更少的查询量
- Curators should also understand the metrics that are available through The Graph Explorer. Metrics like past query volume and who the subgraph developer is can help determine whether or not a subgraph is worth signalling on.

### 3. 升级一个子图的成本是多少？

Migrating your curation shares to a new subgraph version incurs a curation tax of 1%. Curators can choose to subscribe to the newest version of a subgraph. When curator shares get auto-migrated to a new version, Curators will also pay half curation tax, ie. 0.5%, because upgrading subgraphs is an on-chain action that costs gas.

### 4. 我多长时间可以升级我的子图？

建议你不要太频繁地升级你的子图。 更多细节请见上面的问题。

### 5. 我可以出售我的策展股份吗？

Curation shares cannot be "bought" or "sold" like other ERC20 tokens that you may be familiar with. They can only be minted (created) or burned (destroyed) along the bonding curve for a particular subgraph. The amount of GRT needed to mint a new signal, and the amount of GRT you receive when you burn your existing signal are determined by that bonding curve. As a Curator, you need to know that when you burn your curation shares to withdraw GRT, you can end up with more or less GRT than you initially deposited.
