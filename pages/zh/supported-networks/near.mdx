title: 在 NEAR 上构建子图
---

> Graph节点和托管服务中对NEAR 的支持目前处于测试阶段：任何有关构建 NEAR 子图的任何问题，请联系 near@thegraph.com！

本指南介绍了如何在[NEAR区块链](https://docs.near.org/)上构建索引智能合约的子图。

## NEAR是什么？

[NEAR](https://near.org/) 是一个用于构建去中心化应用程序的智能合约平台。 请访问 [官方文档](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/new-to-near) 了解更多信息。

## NEAR子图是什么？

Graph 为开发人员提供了一种被称为子图的工具，利用这个工具，开发人员能够处理区块链事件，并通过 GraphQL API提供结果数据。 [Graph节点](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node)现在能够处理 NEAR 事件，这意味着 NEAR 开发人员现在可以构建子图来索引他们的智能合约。

子图是基于事件的，这意味着子图可以侦听并处理链上事件。 NEAR 子图目前支持两种类型的处理程序：

- 区块处理器: 这些处理程序在每个新区块上运行
- 收据处理器: 每次在指定帐户上一个消息被执行时运行。

[NEAR 文档中](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/transaction#receipt):

> Receipt是系统中唯一可操作的对象。 当我们在 NEAR 平台上谈论“处理交易”时，这最终意味着在某个时候“应用收据”。

## 构建NEAR子图

`@graphprotocol/graph-cli`是一个用于构建和部署子图的命令行工具。

`@graphprotocol/graph-ts` 是子图特定类型的库。

NEAR子图开发需要`0.23.0`以上版本的`graph-cli`，以及 `0.23.0`以上版本的`graph-ts`。

> 构建 NEAR 子图与构建索引以太坊的子图非常相似。

子图定义包括三个方面：

**subgraph.yaml:** 子图清单，定义感兴趣的数据源以及如何处理它们。 NEAR 是一种全新`类型`数据源。

**schema.graphql:** 一个模式文件，它定义为您的子图存储哪些数据，以及如何通过 GraphQL 查询它。 NEAR 子图的要求包含在 [现有文档](/developer/create-subgraph-hosted#the-graphql-schema)中。

**AssemblyScript 映射:**将事件数据转换为模式文件中定义的实体的[AssemblyScript 代码](/developer/assemblyscript-api)。 NEAR 支持引入了 NEAR 特定的数据类型和新的JSON 解析功能。

在子图开发过程中，有两个关键命令：

```bash
$ graph codegen # 从清单中标识的模式文件生成类型
$ graph build # 从 AssemblyScript 文件生成 Web Assembly，并在 /build 文件夹中准备所有子图文件
```

### 子图清单定义

子图清单(`subgraph.yaml`)标识子图的数据源、感兴趣的触发器以及响应这些触发器而运行的函数。 以下是一个NEAR 的子图清单的例子：

```yaml
specVersion: 0.0.2
schema:
  file: ./src/schema.graphql # link to the schema file
dataSources:
  - kind: near
    network: near-mainnet
    source:
      account: app.good-morning.near # This data source will monitor this account
      startBlock: 10662188 # Required for NEAR
    mapping:
      apiVersion: 0.0.5
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      blockHandlers:
        - handler: handleNewBlock # the function name in the mapping file
      receiptHandlers:
        - handler: handleReceipt # the function name in the mapping file
      file: ./src/mapping.ts # link to the file with the Assemblyscript mappings
```

- NEAR subgraphs introduce a new `kind` of data source (`near`)
- The `network` should correspond to a network on the hosting Graph Node. On the Hosted Service, NEAR's mainnet is `near-mainnet`, and NEAR's testnet is `near-testnet`
- NEAR data sources introduce an optional `source.account` field, which is a human readable ID corresponding to a [NEAR account](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account). This can be an account, or a sub account.

NEAR data sources support two types of handlers:

- `blockHandlers`: run on every new NEAR block. No `source.account` is required.
- `receiptHandlers`: run on every receipt where the data source's `source.account` is the recipient. Note that only exact matches are processed ([subaccounts](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account#subaccounts) must be added as independent data sources).

### Schema Definition

Schema definition describes the structure of the resulting subgraph database, and the relationships between entities. This is agnostic of the original data source. There are more details on subgraph schema definition [here](/developer/create-subgraph-hosted#the-graphql-schema).

### AssemblyScript Mappings

The handlers for processing events are written in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/).

NEAR indexing introduces NEAR-specific data types to the [AssemblyScript API](/developer/assemblyscript-api).

```typescript

class ExecutionOutcome {
      gasBurnt: u64,
      blockHash: Bytes,
      id: Bytes,
      logs: Array<string>,
      receiptIds: Array<Bytes>,
      tokensBurnt: BigInt,
      executorId: string,
  }

class ActionReceipt {
      predecessorId: string,
      receiverId: string,
      id: CryptoHash,
      signerId: string,
      gasPrice: BigInt,
      outputDataReceivers: Array<DataReceiver>,
      inputDataIds: Array<CryptoHash>,
      actions: Array<ActionValue>,
  }

class BlockHeader {
      height: u64,
      prevHeight: u64,// Always zero when version < V3
      epochId: Bytes,
      nextEpochId: Bytes,
      chunksIncluded: u64,
      hash: Bytes,
      prevHash: Bytes,
      timestampNanosec: u64,
      randomValue: Bytes,
      gasPrice: BigInt,
      totalSupply: BigInt,
      latestProtocolVersion: u32,
  }

class ChunkHeader {
      gasUsed: u64,
      gasLimit: u64,
      shardId: u64,
      chunkHash: Bytes,
      prevBlockHash: Bytes,
      balanceBurnt: BigInt,
  }

class Block {
      author: string,
      header: BlockHeader,
      chunks: Array<ChunkHeader>,
  }

class ReceiptWithOutcome {
      outcome: ExecutionOutcome,
      receipt: ActionReceipt,
      block: Block,
  }
```

These types are passed to block & receipt handlers:

- Block handlers will receive a `Block`
- Receipt handlers will receive a `ReceiptWithOutcome`

Otherwise the rest of the [AssemblyScript API](/developer/assemblyscript-api) is available to NEAR subgraph developers during mapping execution.

This includes a new JSON parsing function - logs on NEAR are frequently emitted as stringified JSONs. A new `json.fromString(...)` function is available as part of the [JSON API](/developer/assemblyscript-api#json-api) to allow developers to easily process these logs.

## Deploying a NEAR Subgraph

Once you have a built subgraph, it is time to deploy it to Graph Node for indexing. NEAR subgraphs can be deployed to any Graph Node `>=v0.26.x` (this version has not yet been tagged & released).

The Graph's Hosted Service currently supports indexing NEAR mainnet and testnet in beta, with the following network names:

- `near-mainnet`
- `near-testnet`

More information on creating and deploying subgraphs on the Hosted Service can be found [here](/hosted-service/deploy-subgraph-hosted).

As a quick primer - the first step is to "create" your subgraph - this only needs to be done once. On the Hosted Service, this can be done from [your Dashboard](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/dashboard): "Add Subgraph".

Once your subgraph has been created, you can deploy your subgraph by using the `graph deploy` CLI command:

```
$ graph create --node <graph-node-url> subgraph/name # creates a subgraph on a local Graph Node (on the Hosted Service, this is done via the UI)
$ graph deploy --node <graph-node-url> --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/ # uploads the build files to a specified IPFS endpoint, and then deploys the subgraph to a specified Graph Node based on the manifest IPFS hash
```

The node configuration will depend where the subgraph is being deployed.

#### Hosted Service:

```
graph deploy --node https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/ --access-token <your-access-token>
```

#### Local Graph Node (based on default configuration):

```
graph deploy --node http://localhost:8020/ --ipfs http://localhost:5001
```

Once your subgraph has been deployed, it will be indexed by Graph Node. You can check its progress by querying the subgraph itself:

```
{
  _meta {
    block { number }
  }
}
```

### Indexing NEAR with a Local Graph Node

Running a Graph Node that indexes NEAR has the following operational requirements:

- NEAR Indexer Framework with Firehose instrumentation
- NEAR Firehose Component(s)
- Graph Node with Firehose endpoint configured

We will provide more information on running the above components soon.

## Querying a NEAR Subgraph

The GraphQL endpoint for NEAR subgraphs is determined by the schema definition, with the existing API interface. Please visit the [GraphQL API documentation](/developer/graphql-api) for more information.

## Example Subgraphs

Here are some example subgraphs for reference:

[NEAR Blocks](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph/tree/near-blocks-example)

[NEAR Receipts](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph/tree/near-receipts-example)

## 常见问题

### How does the beta work?

NEAR support is in beta, which means that there may be changes to the API as we continue to work on improving the integration. Please email near@thegraph.com so that we can support you in building NEAR subgraphs, and keep you up to date on the latest developments!

### Can a subgraph index both NEAR and EVM chains?

No, a subgraph can only support data sources from one chain / network.

### Can subgraphs react to more specific triggers?

Currently, only Block and Receipt triggers are supported. We are investigating triggers for function calls to a specified account. We are also interested in supporting event triggers, once NEAR has native event support.

### Will receipt handlers trigger for accounts and their sub accounts?

Receipt handlers will only be triggered for the exact-match of the named account. More flexibility may be added in future.

### Can NEAR subgraphs make view calls to NEAR accounts during mappings?

This is not supported. We are evaluating whether this functionality is required for indexing.

### Can I use data source templates in my NEAR subgraph?

This is not currently supported. We are evaluating whether this functionality is required for indexing.

### Ethereum subgraphs support "pending" and "current" versions, how can I deploy a "pending" version of a NEAR subgraph?

Pending functionality is not yet supported for NEAR subgraphs. In the interim, you can deploy a new version to a different "named" subgraph, and then when that is synced with the chain head, you can redeploy to your primary "named" subgraph, which will use the same underlying deployment ID, so the main subgraph will be instantly synced.

### My question hasn't been answered, where can I get more help building NEAR subgraphs?

If it is a general question about subgraph development, there is a lot more information in the rest of the [Developer documentation](/developer/quick-start). Otherwise please join [The Graph Protocol Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) and ask in the #near channel, or email near@thegraph.com.
