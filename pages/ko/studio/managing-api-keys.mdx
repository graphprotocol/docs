title: Managing your API keys
---

Regardless of whether you’re a dapp developer or a subgraph developer, you’ll need to manage your API keys. This is important for you to be able to query subgraphs because API keys make sure the connections between application services are valid and authorized. This includes authenticating the end user and the device using the application.

Studio는 기존 API 키를 나열하여 관리하거나 삭제할 수 있는 기능을 제공합니다.

1. **Overview** 섹션에서는 다음을 수행할 수 있습니다.
   - 키 이름 수정
   - API 키 재생성
   - 통계와 함께 API 키의 현재 사용량 보기:
     - 쿼리 수
     - GRT 소비량
2. Under **Security**, you’ll be able to opt into security settings depending on the level of control you’d like to have over your API keys. In this section, you can:
   - API 키를 사용하도록 승인된 도메인 이름 보기 및 관리
   - API 키로 쿼리할 수 있는 서브그래프 할당
3. Under **Indexer Preference**, you’ll be able to set different preferences for Indexers who are indexing subgraphs that your API key is used for. You can assign up to 5 points for each of these:
   - **Fastest Speed**: Time between the query and the response from an indexer. If you mark this as important we will optimize for fast indexers.
   - **Lowest Price**: The amount paid per query. If you mark this as important we will optimize for the less expensive indexers.
   - **Data Freshness**: How recent the latest block an indexer has processed for the subgraph you are querying. If you mark this as important we will optimize to find the indexers with the freshest data.
   - **Economic Security**: The amount of GRT an indexer can lose if they respond incorrectly to your query. If you mark this as important we will optimize for indexers with a large stake.
4. Under **Budget**, you’ll be able to update the maximum price per query. Note that we have a dynamic setting for that that's based on a volume discounting algorithm. **We strongly recommend using the default settings unless you are experiencing a specific problem.** Otherwise, you can update it under "Set a custom maximum budget". On this page you can also view different KPIs (in GRT and USD):
   - Average cost per query
   - Failed queries over max price
   - Most expensive query
