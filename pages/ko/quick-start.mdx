title: Quick Start
---

This guide will quickly take you through how to initialize, create, and deploy your subgraph on:

- **Subgraph Studio** - used only for subgraphs that index **Ethereum mainnet**
- **Hosted Service** - used for subgraphs that index **other networks** outside of Ethereum mainnnet (e.g. Binance, Matic, etc)

## Subgraph Studio

### 1. Install the Graph CLI

The Graph CLI is written in JavaScript and you will need to have either `npm` or `yarn` installed to use it.

```sh
# NPM
$ npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# Yarn
$ yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### 2. Initialize your Subgraph

- Initialize your subgraph from an existing contract.

```sh
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

- Your subgraph slug is an identifier for your subgraph. The CLI tool will walk you through the steps for creating a subgraph, such as contract address, network, etc as you can see in the screenshot below.

### 3. Write your Subgraph

The previous commands creates a scaffold subgraph that you can use as a starting point for building your subgraph. When making changes to the subgraph, you will mainly work with three files:

- Manifest (subgraph.yaml) - The manifest defines what datasources your subgraphs will index.
- Schema (schema.graphql) - The GraphQL schema defines what data you wish to retreive from the subgraph.
- AssemblyScript Mappings (mapping.ts) - This is the code that translates data from your datasources to the entities defined in the schema.

For more information on how to write your subgraph, see [Create a Subgraph](/developer/create-subgraph-hosted).

### 4. Deploy to the Subgraph Studio

- Go to the Subgraph Studio [https://thegraph.com/studio/](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and connect your wallet.
- Click "Create" and enter the subgraph slug you used in step 2.
- Run these commands in the subgraph folder

```sh
$ graph codegen
$ graph build
```

- Authenticate and deploy your subgraph. The deploy key can be found on the Subgraph page in Subgraph Studio.

```sh
$ graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
$ graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

- You will be asked for a version label. It's strongly recommended to use the following conventions for naming your versions. Example: `0.0.1`, `v1`, `version1`

### 5. Check your logs

The logs should tell you if there are any errors. If your subgraph is failing, you can query the subgraph health by using the [GraphiQL Playground](https://graphiql-online.com/). Use [this endpoint](https://api.thegraph.com/index-node/graphql). Note that you can leverage the query below and input your deployment ID for your subgraph. In this case, `Qm...` is the deployment ID (which can be located on the Subgraph page under **Details**). The query below will tell you when a subgraph fails so you can debug accordingly:

```sh
{
  indexingStatuses(subgraphs: ["Qm..."]) {
    node
    synced
    health
    fatalError {
      message
      block {
        number
        hash
      }
      handler
    }
    nonFatalErrors {
      message
      block {
        number
        hash
      }
      handler
    }
    chains {
      network
      chainHeadBlock {
        number
      }
      earliestBlock {
        number
      }
      latestBlock {
        number
      }
      lastHealthyBlock {
        number
      }
    }
    entityCount
  }
}
```

### 6. Query your Subgraph

You can now query your subgraph by following [these instructions](/developer/query-the-graph). You can query from your dapp if you don't have your API key via the free, rate limited temporary query URL that can be used for development and staging. You can read the additional instructions for how to query a subgraph from a frontend application [here](/developer/querying-from-your-app).

## Hosted Service

### 1. Install the Graph CLI

"The Graph CLI is an npm package and you will need `npm` or `yarn` installed to use it.

```sh
# NPM
$ npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# Yarn
$ yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### 2. Initialize your Subgraph

- Initialize your subgraph from an existing contract.

```sh
$ graph init --product hosted-service --from-contract <Address>
```

- You will be asked for a subgraph name. The format is `<Github>/<Subgraph Name>`. Ex: `graphprotocol/examplesubgraph`

- If you'd like to initialize from an example, run the command below:

```sh
$ graph init --product hosted-service --from-example
```

- In the case of the example, the subgraph is based on the Gravity contract by Dani Grant that manages user avatars and emits `NewGravatar` or `UpdateGravatar` events whenever avatars are created or updated.

### 3. Write your Subgraph

The previous command will have created a scaffold from where you can build your subgraph. When making changes to the subgraph, you will mainly work with three files:

- Manifest (subgraph.yaml) - The manifest defines what datasources your subgraph will index
- Schema (schema.graphql) - The GraphQL schema define what data you wish to retrieve from the subgraph
- AssemblyScript Mappings (mapping.ts) - This is the code that translates data from your datasources to the entities defined in the schema

For more information on how to write your subgraph, see [Create a Subgraph](/developer/create-subgraph-hosted).

### 4. Deploy your Subgraph

- Sign into the [Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/) using your github account
- Click Add Subgraph and fill out the required information. Use the same subgraph name as in step 2.
- Run codegen in the subgraph folder

```sh
 # NPM
$ npm run codegen

# Yarn
$ yarn codegen
```

- Add your Access token and deploy your subgraph. The access token is found on your dashboard in the Hosted Service.

```sh
$ graph auth --product hosted-service <ACCESS_TOKEN>
$ graph deploy --product hosted-service <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH NAME>
```

### 5. Check your logs

The logs should tell you if there are any errors. If your subgraph is failing, you can query the subgraph health by using the [GraphiQL Playground](https://graphiql-online.com/). Use [this endpoint](https://api.thegraph.com/index-node/graphql). Note that you can leverage the query below and input your deployment ID for your subgraph. In this case, `Qm...` is the deployment ID (which can be located on the Subgraph page under **Details**). The query below will tell you when a subgraph fails so you can debug accordingly:

```sh
{
  indexingStatuses(subgraphs: ["Qm..."]) {
    node
    synced
    health
    fatalError {
      message
      block {
        number
        hash
      }
      handler
    }
    nonFatalErrors {
      message
      block {
        number
        hash
      }
      handler
    }
    chains {
      network
      chainHeadBlock {
        number
      }
      earliestBlock {
        number
      }
      latestBlock {
        number
      }
      lastHealthyBlock {
        number
      }
    }
    entityCount
  }
}
```

### 6. Query your Subgraph
