title: Network Overview

The Graph Network is a decentralized indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. Applications use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network. With The Graph, developers can build serverless applications that run entirely on public infrastructure.

## نظره عامة

شبكة TheGraph يتكون من مفهرسين (indexer) ومنسقين (Curators) ومفوضين (Delegator) حيث يقدمون خدماتهم لشبكة ويقدمون البيانات لتطبيقات Web3. Consumers use the applications and consume the data.

![Token Economics](/img/Network-roles@2x.png)

To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants stake and use Graph Tokens (GRT). GRT is a work token that is an ERC-20 on the Ethereum blockchain, used to allocate resources in the network. Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can provide services and earn income from the network, proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake.
