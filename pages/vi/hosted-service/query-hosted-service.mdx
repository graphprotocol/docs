title: Query the Hosted Service
---

With the subgraph deployed, visit the [Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/) to open up a [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) interface where you can explore the deployed GraphQL API for the subgraph by issuing queries and viewing the schema.

An example is provided below, but please see the [Query API](/developer/graphql-api) for a complete reference on how to query the subgraph's entities.

#### Example

This query lists all the counters our mapping has created. Since we only create one, the result will only contain our one `default-counter`:

```graphql
{
  counters {
    id
    value
  }
}
```

## Using The Hosted Service

The Graph Explorer and its GraphQL playground is a useful way to explore and query deployed subgraphs on the Hosted Service.

Some of the main features are detailed below:
