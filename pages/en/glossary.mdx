- **The Graph**: A decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains.

- **Query**: A request for data from a database. In the case of The Graph, a query is a request for data from a subgraph.

- **Subgraph**: A subgraph is a custom API built on blockchain data and can be queried using the [GraphQL query language](https://graphql.org/). Developers can build and deploy subgraphs to The Graph's decentralized network. Then, Indexers can process subgraphs and make them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

- **Hosted Service**: A temporary scaffold service for building and querying subgraphs while The Graph's decentralized network matures the cost of service, quality of service, and developer experience.

- **Indexers**: Network participants that run indexing nodes to provide access to subgraphs.

- **Indexer revenue streams**: Indexer's rewarded in GRT and are made up of two components: indexing rewards and query fee rebates.

  1. **Query fee rebates**: Payments from subgraph consumers for serving queries on the network.

  2. **Indexing rewards**: The rewards that Indexers receive for indexing subgraph deployments. Indexing rewards are generated via new issuance of 3% GRT annually.

- **Indexer's stake**: The amount of GRT that Indexers stake to process subgraphs on the network. The minimum is 100,000 GRT, and there is no upper limit.

- **Delegators**: Individuals who own GRT and stake (delegate) their GRT to Indexers. This allows Indexers to increase their stake in subgraphs on the network. In return, Delegators receive a portion of the Indexing Rewards that Indexers receive for processing subgraphs.

- **Delegation tax**: A 0.5% fee paid by Delegators when they delegate GRT to Indexers. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Curators**: Curators identify high-quality subgraphs, and “curate” them (i.e., signaling GRT on them) to earn curation shares, which guarantee a percentage of all future query fees generated by the subgraph.

- **Curation tax**: A 1% fee paid by Curators when they signal GRT on subgraphs. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Subgraph consumers**: Any application or user that queries a subgraph.

- **Subgraph developer**: A developer who builds and deploys a subgraph to The Graph's decentralized network.

- **Subgraph manifest**: A JSON file that describes the subgraph's GraphQL schema, data sources, and other metadata.

- **Rebate pool**: An economic security measure that holds query fees paid by subgraph consumers. Indexers must wait for an epoch to close

- **Epoch**: A period of time that is used to measure the performance of Indexers. At the end of an epoch, Indexers are rewarded for their performance. Epochs are broken down into 4 phases:

  1. Active:

  2. Settling:

  3. Distributing:

  4. Finalized:

- **Subgraph Studio**:

- **Fishermen**:

- **Arbitrators**:

- **Indexing Rewards**: The rewards that Indexers receive for processing subgraphs. Indexing rewards are paid out in GRT.

- **Delegation Rewards**: The rewards that Delegators receive for delegating GRT to Indexers. Delegation rewards are paid out in GRT.

- **GRT**: The Graph's work utility token. GRT is used for providing economic incentives to network participants for contributing to the network.

- **Indexing Node**: A server that runs an Indexer's indexer-agent software. Indexing nodes process subgraphs and make them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

- **Indexing Node Operators**: The people who run indexing nodes.

- **Indexer-Agent**: The software that runs on an Indexing Node. It processes subgraphs and makes them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

- **Indexing Service**: The service provided by Indexers to the network by processing subgraphs and making them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

- **Subgraph Consumers**: Applications that query subgraphs.

- **The Graph Explorer**: A tool for exploring and querying subgraphs.

- **Graph Explorer**:

- **Graph CLI**:

- **Query rewards**: The rewards that Indexers receive for processing subgraphs. Query rewards are paid out in GRT.

- **Signal Pool**: The on-chain contract that holds the GRT that Curators stake to signal their support for subgraphs.
