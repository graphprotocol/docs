- **The Graph**: A decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data.

- **Query**: A request for data. In the case of The Graph, a query is a request for data from a subgraph that will be answered by an Indexer.

- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. The Graph uses GraphQL to query subgraphs.

- **Subgraph**: A custom API built on blockchain data that can be queried using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). Developers can build, deploy and publish subgraphs to The Graph's decentralized network. Then, Indexers can begin indexing subgraphs to make them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

- **Hosted Service**: A temporary scaffold service for building and querying subgraphs while The Graph's decentralized network matures its cost of service, quality of service, and developer experience.

- **Indexers**: Network participants that run indexing nodes to serve queries to subgraphs.

- **Indexer Revenue Streams**: Indexers are rewarded in GRT with two components: query fee rebates and indexing rewards.

  1. **Query Fee Rebates**: Payments from subgraph consumers for serving queries on the network.

  2. **Indexing Rewards**: The rewards that Indexers receive for indexing subgraphs. Indexing rewards are generated via new issuance of 3% GRT annually.

- **Indexer's Self Stake**: The amount of GRT that Indexers stake to process subgraphs on the network. The minimum is 100,000 GRT, and there is no upper limit.

- **Delegators**: Network participants who own GRT and stake (delegate) their GRT to Indexers. This allows Indexers to increase their stake in subgraphs on the network. In return, Delegators receive a portion of the Indexing Rewards that Indexers receive for processing subgraphs.

- **Delegation Tax**: A 0.5% fee paid by Delegators when they delegate GRT to Indexers. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Curators**: Network participants that identify high-quality subgraphs, and “curate” them (i.e., signal GRT on them) to earn curation shares, which guarantee a percentage of all future query fees generated by the subgraph. Curating a subgraph increases its chances of being indexed by an Indexer.

- **Curation Tax**: A 1% fee paid by Curators when they signal GRT on subgraphs. The GRT used to pay the fee is burned.

- **Subgraph Consumer**: Any application or user that queries a subgraph.

- **Subgraph Developer**: A developer who builds and deploys a subgraph to The Graph's decentralized network.

- **Subgraph Manifest**: A JSON file that describes the subgraph's GraphQL schema, data sources, and other metadata.

- **Rebate Pool**: An economic security measure that holds query fees paid by subgraph consumers. Indexers must wait for an epoch to close before they can claim their query fee rebates.

- **Epoch**: A period of time that is used to measure the performance of Indexers. At the end of an epoch, Indexers are rewarded for their performance.

- **Allocation**: An Indexer can allocate self and delegated stake towards subgraphs that have been published on The Graph's decentralized network. This is called opening an allocation, and indicates to the network that the Indexer is actively indexing and serving queries to the subgraph. Open allocations accrue indexing rewards proportional to the signal on the subgraph, and the amount of GRT allocated. An Indexer may claim the accrued indexing rewards on a given subgraph by submitting a recent, and valid, Proof of Indexing (POI). This is known as closing an allocation. The maximum allocation period is 28 epochs. If an indexer leaves an allocation open beyond 28 epochs, it is known as a stale allocation. Allocations exist in one of four phases:

  1. **Active**: An allocation is considered active when it is created on-chain. The Indexer agent manages creating allocations based on the Indexer rules.

  2. **Closed**: An Indexer can close an allocation once an epoch has passed, or their Indexer agent will automatically close the allocation after ~26 days. During this time, a fisherman can open a dispute to challenge an Indexer for serving false data.

  3. **Finalized**: The dispute period has ended, and all rewards are available to be claimed by Indexers and Delegators.

  4. **Claimed**: The final phase of an allocation, all eligible rewards have been distributed and claimed.

- **Subgraph Studio**: A powerful dapp for building, deploying, and publishing subgraphs.

- **Fishermen**: Network participants that monitor query results served by Indexers. Fishermen are rewarded with GRT and receive 50% of the Indexer's indexing rewards for that epoch if they find an Indexer serving false data.

- **Arbitrators**: Network participants that guarantee network security by resolving disputes between Indexers and Fishermen.

- **Slashing**: Indexers can have their rewards slashed for serving false data. The Indexer's self stake is slashed by 2.5% and the entirety of the rewards for that epoch are slashed as well. 50% of the Indexer’s indexing rewards for that epoch are burned, and the other 50% are rewarded to the Fisherman.

- **Indexing Rewards**: The rewards that Indexers receive for processing subgraphs. Indexing rewards are paid out in GRT.

- **Delegation Rewards**: The rewards that Delegators receive for delegating GRT to Indexers. Delegation rewards are paid out in GRT.

- **GRT**: The Graph's work utility token. GRT provides economic incentives to network participants for contributing to the network.

- **Indexing Node**: A server that runs an Indexer's indexer-agent software. Indexing nodes process subgraphs and make them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

- **Indexing Node Operators**: The people who run indexing nodes.

- **POI or Proof of Indexing**: POIs are used to verify that an Indexer is indexing the subgraphs they have allocated on.

- **Indexer-Agent**: The software that runs on an Indexing Node. It processes subgraphs and makes them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

- **The Graph Client**: A library for building GraphQL-based dapps in a decentralized way.

- **Graph Node**: An open source Rust implementation that event sources the Ethereum blockchain to deterministically update a data store that can be queried via the GraphQL endpoint.

- **Graph Explorer**: A dapp designed for network participants to explore subgraphs and interact with the protocol.

- **Graph CLI**: A command line interface tool for building and deploying to The Graph.

- **Signal Pool**: The on-chain contract that holds the GRT that Curators stake to signal their support for subgraphs.

- **Cooldown Period**: The time remaining until an Indexer who changed their delegation parameters can do so again.
