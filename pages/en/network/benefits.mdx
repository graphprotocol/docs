---

The Graph’s decentralized network has been engineered and refined to create a robust indexing and querying experience—and it’s getting better every day thanks to hundreds of contributors around the world. The benefits of this decentralized protocol cannot be replicated by running a graph node locally. The Graph Network is more reliable, more efficient, and less expensive. Here is an analysis:

## Why You Should Use The Graph Network

- 60-98% lower monthly cost
- $0 setup costs (except signal which can be withdrawn anytime)
- Superior uptime thanks to global redundancy
- Access to 168 Indexers (and counting)
- 24/7 technical support by global community

## Breaking Down the Benefits of Using The Graph Network

### Lower & more flexible cost structure

No contracts. No monthly fees. Only pay for the queries you use—with an average cost-per-query of $0.0002\*<sup>†</sup>

\*Queries are priced in USD and paid for with GRT

<sup>†</sup>Query costs may vary; quoted cost is the average at time of publication

## Low Volume User (less than 30,000 queries per month)

## No Setup Costs & Greater Operational Efficiency

Zero setup fees. Get started immediately with no setup or overhead costs. No hardware requirements. No outages due to centralized infrastructure, and more time to concentrate on your core product . No need for backup servers, troubleshooting, or expensive engineering resources.

## Reliability & Resiliency

The Graph’s decentralized network gives users access to geographic redundancy that does not exist when self-hosting a graph node. Queries are served reliably thanks to 99.9%+ uptime, achieved by 168 Indexers (and counting) securing the network globally.

Bottom line: The Graph Network is less expensive, easier to use, and produces superior results compared to running a graph node locally.
