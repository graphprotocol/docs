title: Define a Subgraph
---

A subgraph defines which data The Graph will index from Ethereum, and how it will store it. Once deployed, it will form a part of a global graph of blockchain data.

The subgraph definition consists of a few files:

- `subgraph.yaml`: a YAML file containing the subgraph manifest

- `schema.graphql`: a GraphQL schema that defines what data is stored for your subgraph, and how to query it via GraphQL

- `AssemblyScript Mappings`: [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript) code that translates from the event data to the entities defined in your schema (e.g. `mapping.ts` in this tutorial)

Before you go into detail about the contents of the manifest file, you need to install the [Graph CLI](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli) which you will need to build and deploy a subgraph.

## Install the Graph CLI

The Graph CLI is written in JavaScript, and you will need to install either `yarn` or `npm` to use it; it is assumed that you have yarn in what follows.

Once you have `yarn`, install the Graph CLI by running

**Install with yarn:**

```bash
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

**Install with npm:**

```bash
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```
