Firehose provides a files-based and streaming-first approach to processing blockchain data.

Firehose integrations have been built for Ethereum (and many EVM chains), NEAR, Solana, Cosmos and Arweave, with more in the works.

Graph Node integrations have been built for multiple chains, so subgraphs can stream data from a Firehose to power performant and scaleable indexing. Firehose also powers [substreams](/substreams), a new transformation technology built by The Graph core developers.
