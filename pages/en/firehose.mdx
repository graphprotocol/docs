title: The Firehose

The Firehose provides a files-based and streaming-first approach to processing blockchain data.

Firehose integrations have been built for Ethereum (and many EVM chains), NEAR, Solana, Cosmos and Arweave, with more in the works.

The Firehose integrates with Graph Node to power performant and scaleable indexing across multiple chains, and powers [substreams](/substreams), a new transformation technology built by The Graph core developers.
