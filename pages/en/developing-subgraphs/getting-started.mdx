title: Getting started
---

This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with subgraph
development:

## 1. Install the Graph CLI

The Graph CLI is written in JavaScript and you will need to have either `npm` or
`yarn` installed to use it.

```sh
# NPM
$ npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli

# Yarn
$ yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

> Note: For the sake of simplicity we will use `yarn` in the examples. You can
> also use `npm` if you prefer.

## 2. Initialize your Subgraph

There are three ways to initialize your subgraph:

1. [**From existing and deployed contract**](#2-1-from-existing-contract): Use
   this if the contract that you want to create a subgraph for is already
   deployed. This is the easiest way to get started.
2. [**From a local ABI file**](#2-2-from-local-abi): Use this if you are
   currently developing the contract and want to create a subgraph from the
   local ABI file.
3. **From example**: Use this if you want to start with the
   [example Gravity subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph).

Also there are two different products that you can use to deploy your subgraph
to:

1. **Subgraph Studio**: This is a web application that helps you deploy your
   subgraph to the decentralized Graph Network. Currently only available for
   Ethererum Mainnet and Rinkeby.
2. **Hosted Service**: The legacy centralized hosted service. Supports other
   networks as well.

## 2.1 From existing contract

```sh
graph init
```

The CLI tool will walk you through the steps for creating a subgraph, such as
contract address, network, etc as you can see in the screenshot below.

> Note: Your subgraph slug is an identifier for your subgraph. If you want to
> deploy to the hosted service the slug should have the form
> `[github-username]/[subgraph-name]`.

```bash
➜ $ graph init
✔ Protocol · ethereum
✔ Product for which to initialize · subgraph-studio
✔ Subgraph slug · crypto-punks
✔ Directory to create the subgraph in · crypto-punks
✔ Ethereum network · mainnet
✔ Contract address · 0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb
✔ Fetching ABI from Etherscan
✔ Contract Name · CryptoPunks
———
  Generate subgraph
  Write subgraph to directory
✔ Create subgraph scaffold
✔ Initialize subgraph repository
✔ Install dependencies with yarn
✔ Generate ABI and schema types with yarn codegen

Subgraph crypto-punks created in crypto-punks

Next steps:

  1. Run `graph auth` to authenticate with your deploy key.

  2. Type `cd crypto-punks` to enter the subgraph.

  3. Run `yarn deploy` to deploy the subgraph.

Make sure to visit the documentation on https://thegraph.com/docs/ for further information.
```

> Pro tipp: Use the `--index-events` flag to automatically create entities and
> associated mappings from the contract's events.

## 2.2 From local ABI

Similar to the previous example, but instead using a local ABI file instead.

```bash
$ graph init --abi path/to/Contract.abi \
  --protocol ethereum \
  --network mainnet \
  --product studio \
  --slug crypto-punks \
  --contract-name CryptoPunks
```

## 2.3 From example

```
graph init --from-example
```

The example subgraph is based on the Gravity contract by Dani Grant that manages
user avatars and emits `NewGravatar` or `UpdateGravatar` events whenever avatars
are created or updated. The subgraph handles these events by writing `Gravatar`
entities to the Graph Node store and ensuring these are updated according to the
events.

## 3. Write your Subgraph

The previous commands creates a scaffold subgraph that you can use as a starting
point for building your subgraph. When making changes to the subgraph, you will
mainly work with three files:

- [Manifest (subgraph.yaml)](../manifest) - The manifest defines what
  datasources your subgraphs will index.
- [Schema (schema.graphql)](../schema) - The GraphQL schema defines what data
  you wish to retreive from the subgraph.
- [AssemblyScript Mappings (mapping.ts)](../assemblyscript) - This is the code
  that translates data from your datasources to the entities defined in the
  schema.

## 4. Deploy your Subgraph

There are three ways to deploy your subgraph:

- [**Subgraph Studio**](../../deploying-subgraphs/studio) to publish your
  subgraph on the decentralized Graph Network
- [**Hosted Service**](../../deploying-subgraphs/hosted-service) to deploy your
  Subgraph to the centralized legacy hosted service.
- [**Local Graph Node**](../../deploying-subgraphs/local-graph-node) to deploy
  your Subgraph to a local Graph Node for testing and development.
