## General FAQs

### Why is The Graph implementing an L2 Solution?

By scaling The Graph on L2, network participants can expect:

- 26x savings on gas fees

- Faster transaction speed

- Secured by Ethereum

The protocol allows network participants to interact more frequently at a reduced cost in gas fees. This enables Indexers to index a greater number of subgraphs, allows developers to deploy and upgrade subgraphs with greater ease, enables Delegators to delegate GRT with increased frequency, and gives Curators the ability to add signal to a larger number of subgraphs.

The Graph community [decided](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0031-arbitrum-grt-bridge/3305) to move forward with Arbitrum last year.

### What do I need to do to use The Graph on L2?

Users bridge their GRT and ETH  using one of the following methods:

- [The Graph Bridge on Arbitrum](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
- [TransferTo](https://transferto.xyz/swap)
- [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/)
- [Hop Exchange](https://app.hop.exchange/#/send?token=ETH)

To take advantage of using The Graph on L2, use this dropdown switcher to toggle between chains.

### As a subgraph developer, data consumer, Indexer, Curator, or Delegator, what do I need to do now?

There is no immediate action required.

Core developer teams are working to create migration helpers that will make it significantly easier to move delegation, curation, and subgraphs to Arbitrum. Network participants can expect migration helpers to be available in April 2023.

The Graph community can also expect indexing rewards to be enabled on Arbitrum in February or March 2023.

### If I would like to participate in the network on L2, what should I do?

Please help [test the network](https://testnet.thegraph.com/explorer) on L2 and report feedback about your experience in [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) in the #mips-goerli-testnet channel.

### Are there any risks associated with scaling the network to L2?

All smart contracts have been thoroughly [audited](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/dev/audits/OpenZeppelin/2022-07-graph-arbitrum-bridge-audit.pdf).

Everything has been tested thoroughly, and a contingency plan is in place to ensure a safe and seamless transition. Details can be found [here](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0037-the-graph-arbitrum-deployment-with-linear-rewards-minted-in-l2/3551#risks-and-security-considerations-20).

### Will existing subgraphs on Ethereum continue to work?

Yes, The Graph Network contracts will operate in parallel on both Ethereum and Arbitrum until moving fully to Arbitrum at a later date.

### Will GRT have a new smart contract deployed on Arbitrum?

Yes, GRT has an additional [smart contract on Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9623063377ad1b27544c965ccd7342f7ea7e88c7). However, the Ethereum mainnet [GRT contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7) will remain operational.

## Billing on Arbitrum FAQs

### What do I need to do about the GRT in my billing balance?

Nothing! Your GRT has been securely migrated to Arbitrum and is being used to pay for queries as you read this.

### How do I know my funds have migrated securely to Arbitrum?

All GRT billing balances have already been successfully migrated to Arbitrum. You can view the billing contract on Arbitrum [here](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1B07D3344188908Fb6DEcEac381f3eE63C48477a).

### How do I know the Arbitrum bridge is secure?

The bridge has been [heavily audited](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-the-graph-l2-bridge-contest) to ensure safety and security for all users.

### What do I need to do if I'm adding fresh GRT from my Ethereum mainnet wallet?

Adding GRT to your Arbitrum billing balance can be done with a one-click experience in [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/). You'll be able to easily bridge your GRT to Arbitrum and fill your API keys in one transaction.

Visit the [Billing page](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/billing/) for more detailed instructions on adding, withdrawing, or acquiring GRT.
