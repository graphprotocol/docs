## Sunsetting the Hosted Service FAQs

### 1. Will the hosted service continue to support Polygon (or any other chain not yet supported on the decentralized network) until the decentralized network is able to adequately support Polygon?

Yes, the hosted service will continue supporting chains that are not yet available on the decentralized network, such as Polygon today.

Support for each chain will deprecate in 3 phases, similarly to [hosted service support of Ethereum](https://thegraph.com/blog/sunsetting-hosted-service):

- Phase 1 - When the chain is fully functional on the decentralized network, creation of new subgraphs for that chain on the hosted service will be halted.

- Phase 2 - Upgrades to subgraphs will only be available on the decentralized network, but will still process queries.

- Phase 3 - The hosted service will stop processing queries. Each chain will go through these phases independently and at their own pace as they're integrated into the decentralized network.

### 2. What happens to the hosted service at the Q1 2023 cutoff date?

Q1 2023 reflects the timeline for decentralized network-supported chains to be sunset on the hosted service.

For example, Ethereum is a decentralized network-supported chain and will follow the phases described above. Core developers are working to implement additional chains on the decentralized network as soon as possible.

### 3. What are Core Developer teams doing to prep for the cross-chain sunsetting roadmap?

Core Developer teams are spearheading two major initiatives to ensure the timely and seamless sunsetting of the hosted service.

The first is the [Epoch Block Oracle](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-epoch-block-oracle/3323) that will unlock indexing rewards and network growth across the many chains supported by the decentralized network.

The second is the Migration Infrastructure Provider (MIPs) program, which is an initiative to encourage Indexer adoption of cross-chain decentralized network functionality. Program participants will operate Indexers on new chains as they become available on the decentralized network. This program will bootstrap supply on the decentralized network and ensure quality of service.  You can learn more about the MIPs program [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/mips-multi-chain-indexing-incentivized-program).

### 4. When will the hosted service be completely sunset?

The hosted service will sunset for chains supported by the decentralized network by Q1 2023. If chain integration on the decentralized network is delayed, support on the hosted service will continue for chains not yet supported on The Graph Network.

### 5. If the decentralized network does not support a non-Ethereum chain (e.g., Polygon, Avalanche, etc.), will it still be sunset on the hosted service by Q1 of 2023?

No, the hosted service will continue supporting chains that are not available on the decentralized network. After support is fully implemented, support on the hosted service will gradually sunset, to ensure developers have plenty of time to migrate.

### 6. Will my subgraph on the hosted service be shut down before I get a chance to migrate?

Subgraph developers will have plenty of time to migrate their subgraph before support for each chain is sunset on the hosted service.

Make sure to follow [@graphprotocol](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol) on Twitter and join The Graph community on [Discord](https://thegraph.com/discord) to stay up to date when network support for each additional chain is added.

If you have questions around migrating your subgraph, contact [migration@thegraph.foundation](mailto:migration@thegraph.foundation) or reach out on [Discord](https://thegraph.com/discord).

### 7. Are there migration grants for subgraphs that migrate early to The Graph Network across chains?

Yes, there will be a migration grant pool for each new chain enabled on the decentralized network, just as there has been for Ethereum subgraphs. The Graph Foundation is still narrowing down the size of each chain's grant pool. Subgraph developers can rest assured, early migrants can get help to bootstrap curation signal and get help with the initial query fees. If you're interested in a migration grant, please contact the community at [migration@thegraph.foundation](mailto:migration@thegraph.foundation).

### 8. When will the decentralized network support my preferred chain?

The first chain that The Graph Network will support outside of Ethereum is Gnosis (formerly xDai) announced [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/mips-multi-chain-indexing-incentivized-program).

Core developers are planning to add as many chains to the decentralized network as possible by Q1 of 2023. Please ask in [Discord](https://thegraph.com/discord) if there are updates on integration for any specific chain(s).

We would love to hear from you! Please tag The Graph on Twitter or comment in [Discord](https://thegraph.com/discord) to let the ecosystem know the chain(s) you would like The Graph ecosystem to prioritize adding to The Graph Network next.

### 9. Will the decentralized network have the same core functionalities as the hosted service?

Yes, the decentralized network provides all core functionalities of the hosted service while being significantly more robust, secure, and reliable. Instead of just one indexing service, The Graph Network is powered by 224 (and counting) independently operated and geographically distributed Indexers.

When you migrate your subgraph to The Graph Network, there is no one to delete the API, there is no one to shut the application down, there is no one to deplatform your application. The decentralized network gets us closer to the "deploy once, live forever" dapp.

### 10. Why should I migrate to the decentralized network and pay for queries in GRT instead of using the hosted service that is "free"?

The hosted service is not "free." The Graph ecosystem has been paying millions of dollars behind the scenes for the hosted service.

All web3 applications require serving blockchain data in order to function. Accessing blockchain data always comes at a cost.

Building an in-house indexing solution is costly, inefficient, and requires significant overhead---all while exposing your users to the risks of downtime and poor UX with centralized infrastructure.

The Graph is the best way to query blockchain data easily, cheaply, quickly, all with the security and permanence offered by decentralization.

If you migrate before the hosted service deprecates, there are opportunities for hands-on technical support, GRT migration grants to assist in attracting Indexers via curation signal and help paying initial query costs, as well as opportunities for prioritized marketing to The Graph's community of [235K+ followers](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol).

Remember, The Graph Network is decentralized. This means there is no centralized actor to close down your API or deplatform you at the indexing and querying layer.

### 11. Will there be a grant program for subgraphs on other chains, similar to the one for subgraphs on Ethereum?

Yes, The Graph Foundation plans to continue awarding [migration grants](https://thegraph.typeform.com/to/Zz8UAPri?typeform-source=thegraph.com) to subgraphs that migrate early to the decentralized network. If you need any help with the migration process, please reach out to migration@thegraph.foundation.

### 12. Is there a planned order by which new chains will be integrated?

The Graph ecosystem is closely monitoring demand for various chains. The Graph's core developers would love to hear from you on which chains you would like to see migrate to The Graph Network first. If you'd like your preferred network to be a priority, please share your ideas with The Graph community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) or [@graphprotocol](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol) on Twitter.

### 13. With one chain currently live on the decentralized network and 39 chains still on the hosted service, how do you plan to migrate all of those chains by Q1 of 2023? ?

The Graph Foundation is fast-tracking support for the decentralized network with the [Migration Infrastructure Partners Program (MIP)](https://thegraph.com/blog/mips-multi-chain-indexing-incentivized-program). This is a partnership program to set up Indexers for new chains as support is added. Program participants will operate Indexers on new chains and provide support for subgraphs on the specific network.\

Core developers are also working on an Epoch Block Oracle, which will unlock indexing rewards and network growth across multiple chains. This is currently an active GIP, which you can learn more about [here](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-epoch-block-oracle/3323).

### 14. How many queries is the decentralized network serving compared to the hosted service?

There are 39 chains/networks and 24K+ active subgraphs on the hosted service, with an average over a billion queries per day and ~694 billion lifetime queries. On the decentralized network, there is currently one chain (Ethereum mainnet) and 430+ subgraphs comprising millions of queries per day and ~5 billion lifetime queries.

### 15. Will I encounter problems as I migrate my subgraph from the hosted service to the decentralized network?

Subgraph migration has been thoroughly tested and documented, with [450+ subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/explorer) having migrated to the decentralized network to date, at the time of this writing.

Plenty of support is available to make migrating your subgraph as effortless as possible. In addition to a direct support contact at [migration@thegraph.foundation](mailto:migration@thegraph.foundation), you can reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vtvv7FP) to connect core developer team members and The Graph community.

In order to leverage the power of the decentralized network, there are steps to take such as publishing the subgraph to the network, signaling GRT on the subgraph to attract Indexers, and filling the API key with GRT. These steps are described in detail [here](https://thegraph.com/blog/how-to-migrate-ethereum-subgraph).

Subgraph developers are encouraged to follow best practices to avoid any issues on the decentralized network. One common challenge stems from multiple Indexers serving queries instead of one. This can lead to unexpected effects, like two subsequent queries resolve at different block heights. A solution to this challenge is provided in [this document](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/distributed-systems/) using the [graph-client](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client). Following these guidelines can result in stable and predictable responses.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out in [Discord](https://thegraph.com/discord) or [migration@thegraph.foundation](mailto:migration@thegraph.foundation) any time. The community is here to help you migrate and decentralize your dapp's data layer!

### 16. Can I go back to the hosted service if I'm unhappy with the decentralized network?

Subgraph developers are free to use the hosted service for as long as it is available. However, you're encouraged to share feedback about the decentralized network in Discord if there are any additional features you'd like to request.
