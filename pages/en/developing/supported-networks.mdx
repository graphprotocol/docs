## The Graph Decentralized Network

The Graph Network supports subgraphs indexing the Ethereum mainnet and Rinkeby testnet:

- `mainnet`
- `rinkeby`

## Hosted Service

**The following networks are supported in beta on the Hosted Service**:

- `mainnet`
- `kovan`
- `rinkeby`
- `ropsten`
- `goerli`
- `poa-core`
- `poa-sokol`
- `xdai` (now known as Gnosis Chain)
- `near-mainnet`
- `near-testnet`
- `matic` (now known as Polygon)
- `mumbai`
- `fantom`
- `bsc` (now known as BNB Chain)
- `chapel`
- `clover`
- `avalanche`
- `fuji`
- `celo`
- `celo-alfajores`
- `fuse`
- `moonriver`
- `mbase`
- `arbitrum-one`
- `arbitrum-rinkeby`
- `optimism`
- `optimism-kovan`
- `aurora`
- `aurora-testnet`
- `boba`
- `harmony`
- `arweave-mainnet`
- `cosmoshub-4`
- `theta-testnet-001` (this is the current Cosmos Hub testnet)

> The Graph's Hosted Service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints. Newer networks will be marked as being in beta until the network has proven itself in terms of stability, reliability, and scalability. During this beta period, there is a risk of downtime and unexpected behaviour.

Remember that you will **not be able** to publish a subgraph that indexes a non-mainnet network to the decentralized Graph Network in [Subgraph Studio](/deploying/subgraph-studio).
