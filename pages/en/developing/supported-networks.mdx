## The Graph Decentralized Network

The following chains are supported on The Graph Decentralized Network:

- Ethereum Mainnet
- Gnosis (also known as xdai)

Indexers on The Graph Network can offer full support & security for mainnet Ethereum and Gnosis subgraphs. See which networks are supported and more information on deploying to the network [here](/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-studio).

Remember that you will **not be able** to publish a subgraph that indexes a non-mainnet network to the decentralized Graph Network in [Subgraph Studio](/deploying/subgraph-studio).

## Graph Node

You can run your own Graph Node to index any EVM-compatible chain. Make sure that the [version](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/releases) you are using supports the network and you have the needed configuration.

Graph Node can also index other protocols, via a Firehose integration. Firehose integrations have been created for NEAR, Arweave and Cosmos-based chains.

## Hosted Service

The following protocols are supported on the Hosted Service:

- Ethereum
- Near
- Cosmos
- Arweave

See the list of which networks are supported [here](/deploying/deploying-a-subgraph-to-hosted).

> The Graph's Hosted Service relies on the stability and reliability of the underlying technologies, namely the provided JSON RPC endpoints. Newer networks will be marked as being in beta until the network has proven itself in terms of stability, reliability, and scalability. During this beta period, there is a risk of downtime and unexpected behaviour.
