      # And here's the second place - this runs after we have both the current and
      # base branch bundle stats, and will compare them to determine what changed.
      # There are two configurable arguments that come from package.json:
      #
      # - budget: optional, set a budget (bytes) against which size changes are measured
      #           it's set to 350kb here by default, as informed by the following piece:
      #           https://infrequently.org/2021/03/the-performance-inequality-gap/
      #
      # - red-status-percentage: sets the percent size increase where you get a red
      #                          status indicator, defaults to 20%
      #
      # Either of these arguments can be changed or removed by editing the `nextBundleAnalysis`
      # entry in your package.json file.
